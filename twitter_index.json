OAuth is a secure connection method and doesnât require you to give your Twitter username and password to the third party. You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give your username and password to an app or website. When you give your username and password to someone else, they can gain complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a login page for a third-party app is using OAuth, go directly to twitter.com and enter your credentials there, and then navigate back to the app. If the app is using OAuth, the app should not require you to enter your username and password again. You can learn more about how to check that youâre on twitter.com with our account security tips.\n\nIf you previously provided your password to an app that you are now unsure about, revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You should be especially wary of and never provide your username and password to:\nWebsites claiming to help you",

Thereâs still a ton of folks we havenât reached, but Twitter helped us grow from 5 followers to 5,000. Finally, it was important to be unafraid to share voices. When we first started out, we tried to avoid âspammingâ the timeline. But we realized that by Retweeting Latinx folks, and Retweeting responses to us, we were building an audience and giving folks a platform to see and find each other. We were a mouthpiece and it was",

It's the platform that houses all the discussions, updates and news in the Gaming industry, but also allows you to express your personality.Â \nGaming is...interesting. Since a young age, Iâve enjoyed escaping to various fantasy worlds but it was always a matter of time until I was brought back to reality. When I was young, it was in the form of absence of Black women characters ââ one or two would grace the screen but as stereotypes that were so predictable, bland, and offensive. Now donât get me wrong, I didnât expect Black women to be in Crash Bandicoot (a game about a spinning marsupial), but our appearances were so far and few between that, at one point, I believed gaming to be a completely white male hobby.Â\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers",

They were so frequently rooted in assimilation or fear of rocking developersâ boats. I felt concessions were made on the behalf of Black gamers to comfort developer fragility that would hold us back in the long run. Ultimately, something was missing from these discussions, and in hindsight itâs only now that I realise it was the vim. To be vocal online meant braving a tidal wave of whitesplaining, mansplaining, or racist responses.

Having a Twitter page brought visibility to our experiences and opinions to many, including those who disagreed with our Tweets.

        "text": "that you're on twitter.comâ¨ â¨\nPhishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving up your Twitter username, email address or phone number and password, usually so they can send out spam from your account. Often, theyâll try to trick you with a link that goes to a fake login page. Whenever you are prompted to enter your Twitter password, take a quick look at the URL in the address bar of your browser to make sure you're on twitter.com. Additionally, if you receive a Direct Message (even from a friend) with a URL that looks odd, we recommend you do not open the link.\nPhishing websites will often look just like Twitter's login page, but will actually be a website that is not Twitter. Twitter domains will always have https://twitter.com/ as the base domain. Here are some examples of Twitter login pages:â¨\nÂ https://twitter.comâ¨Â https://twitter.com/login\nIf you are ever unsure about a login page, go directly to twitter.com and enter your credentials there. If you think you may have been phished, change your password as soon as possible and visit our compromised account article for additional instructions.Â \nRead about fake Twitter emails for more information about phishing through email.Â  â¨â¨\nWe won't contact you asking for your passwordâ¨â¨\nTwitter will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.\nWe will never ask",

However, you should be cautious before giving third-party applications access to your account.\nIf you wish to grant a third-party application access to your account, we recommend that you only do so using Twitterâs OAuth method.

For the sake of reliability, we've placed some limits on the account actions below.\nÂ \nCurrent Twitter limits\n Â \nThe current technical limits for accounts are:\nDirect Messages (daily): The limit is 500 messages sent per day.Tweets: 2,400 per day. The daily update limit is further broken down into smaller limits for semi-hourly intervals. Retweets are counted as Tweets.Changes to account email: 4 per hour.Following (daily): The technical follow limit is 400 per day. Please note that this is a technical account limit only, and there are additional rules prohibiting aggressive following behavior.Â Following (account-based): Once an account is following 5,000 other accounts, additional follow attempts are limited by account-specific ratios.Â \nThese limits include actions from all devices, including web, mobile, phone, API, etc. API requests from all third-party applications are tracked against the hourly API limit. People who use multiple third-party applications with their account will therefore reach the API limit more quickly.Â \nThese limits may be temporarily reduced during periods of heavy site usage. In such cases, we will post an update on the Twitter status site.\nÂ \nWhat",

What should I do?\n\nIf youâre still havingÂ login issuesÂ after resetting your Twitter password, you may beÂ locked outÂ of your account for security purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhat if Iâm not receiving texts or verification codes from Twitter?\n\nYouâll want to make sure you have cell reception or internet access, and that the Twitter number isnât blocked. It can take a few minutes to receive a verification code. If youâre still having trouble, try the email password reset option.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHow do I reset my Twitter password without email or a phone number?\n\nWe use your email address and phone number to verify your identity, so when you canât access this information, recovery options are limited. If you know your Twitter username, we may be able to help with your login issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhy do I keep getting password reset emails?\n\nIf you frequently receive password reset messages that you did not request, it may be a good idea to turn on theÂ Password reset protectionÂ in your account settings and set upÂ two-factor authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          More password help\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes there are circumstances that lead to losing access to the verification information you need to log into your Twitter account.Â After trying the tips below, if you still canât recover your password and access your account, contactÂ Twitter Support.Â Please note that without an email or phone number to verify your identity, recovery options are limited.Â \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Recovery tips\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in with the username and password combination you last remember.Â Check other platfoms.Â Look to see if you are still logged into your account elsewhere like the Twitter app, mobile.twitter.com or TweetDeck.Verify what you can.

You can learn more about the specific access in the App permissionsÂ section below. Addiontally you can choose to log out of your active Twitter sessions.Â \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You should be cautious before giving any third-party app access to your account. If youâre not comfortable with granting an app access to your account, simply click âcancelâ on the authorization page to decline the appâs access. We also suggest you regularly review third-party apps which have access to use your account to confirm that you still want to give them access.

For example, the Popular Videos Timeline created by Twitter, uses similar information to how we select topics to populate and order video content.Â Â \nThese custom feeds run parallel to the Home timeline and appear on a separate tab after you add a custom Timeline from a prompt. Easily switch between tabs for more control of your Twitter experience as you deep-dive into the content that interests you most.\nÂ \nNote: Content that appears in a custom Timeline is selected and ordered based on relevance to the Timeline's theme using information like search terms, Topics, handles, and manual curation.Â \n\nÂ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How to add a custom Timeline on twitter.com\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you see a prompt about a custom Timeline on the Home screen, you can easily add it by following the steps below.

These formats are designed to easily engage with content and make your timeline more dynamic and visual.Â Â \n\nWhen someone in our initial test group posts a Tweet Tile, people on iOS and web who are part of this experiment will automatically see the Tweet Tiles they post on the Home timeline. Like Tweet Cards, Tweet Tiles render automatically when you paste a URL.Â \n\nPlease note: Not all followers will automatically see the Tweet Tiles, and if you Retweet a Tweet Tile or share a Tweet Tile URL, others might not be able to see it.Â\n\n\n=== Timelines ===\n\nThird-party apps are applications built on the Twitter platform by external developers, and are not owned or operated by Twitter. When you connect a third-party app to your Twitter account, you are granting that app access to use your account. Depending on its permissions, an authorized app may be able to obtain information from and use your account in various ways, such as reading your Tweets, seeing who you follow, updating your profile, posting Tweets on your behalf, accessing your Direct Messages, or seeing your email address. You can learn more about the specific access in the App permissionsÂ section below. Addiontally you can choose to log out of your active Twitter sessions.Â \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You should be cautious before giving any third-party app access to your account. If youâre not comfortable with granting an app access to your account, simply click âcancelâ on the authorization page to decline the appâs access. We also suggest you regularly review third-party apps which have access to use your account to confirm that you still want to give them access. You can review and revoke access for apps by visiting the Apps and sessions section of your account settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging out of active Twitter sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n      How to log out of your active Twitter sessions\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign in to your account.\nFrom yourÂ Settings and privacy, go to theÂ Apps and sessionsÂ section of your account settings.

Remember that when you authorize an app to access your Twitter account or take actions on your behalf, the app may use, store, and share your information in accordance with its own business practices. While app developers agree to abide by our rules and guidelines, we strongly recommend that you review an appâs terms and privacy policy before you authorize the app to access your account.\nLearn more about our rules and guidelines for third-party app developers in our Developer Policy.\nÂ\n\n\n=== Timelines ===\n\nHow to connect to a third-party app\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 1\n          \n\nIn the app you want to connect, find the button/link asking you to connect your Twitter account (usually \"Connect to Twitter\", \"Sign in with Twitter\" or something similar).\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 2\n          \n\nDepending on the app, you may be presented with a consent dialog from Twitter asking you to authorize the app to use your account or you may be prompted to grant the app access to the Twitter accounts on your iOS device.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 3\n          \n\nYou can review the various permissions you are granting to the app. You will see examples of actions the app will be able to perform using your account.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 4\n          \n\nIf you are routed to a Twitter website and youâre already logged in to your account, use the Authorize app button to connect the app. If youâre not already logged in to your account, you will need to log in.

These formats are designed to easily engage with content and make your timeline more dynamic and visual.Â Â \n\nWhen someone in our initial test group posts a Tweet Tile, people on iOS and web who are part of this experiment will automatically see the Tweet Tiles they post on the Home timeline. Like Tweet Cards, Tweet Tiles render automatically when you paste a URL.Â \n\nPlease note: Not all followers will automatically see the Tweet Tiles, and if you Retweet a Tweet Tile or share a Tweet Tile URL, others might not be able to see it.Â\n\n\n=== What is the Tweet activity dashboard? ===\n\nWhat is the Tweet activity dashboard?\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tweet activity dashboard is a tool you can use to learn more about your Tweets and how they resonate with your audience.Â \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the activity dashboard to:Â \nÂ \nSee how people engage with your Tweets in real time.Compare your Tweet activity and followers, and see how they trend over time.Click on any Tweet to get a detailed view of the number of Retweets, replies, likes, follows, or clicks it receives.Get detailed insights into who your audience is, especially those who engage with your Tweets.Download your Tweet metrics.\nÂ \n\n\n\n\nTo get started accessing your Tweet activity, log in to analytics.twitter.com with your Twitter username and password.Â \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How to access the dashboard\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Twitter for iOS app: \nMake sure you have installed the latest version of Twitter for iPhone or iPad.Â Tap the analytics icon visible in your Tweets.Â \n\n\n\n\nThe Tweet activity dashboard is available to users who primarily Tweet in Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, and have had an account for at least 14 days.

The heart of this brand is a virtual community of Black creative professionals looking to create full, healthy, and sustainable lives ââ much like what my parents set out to do.\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\nTwitter has become a vital tool for how we not only build, but sustain theÂ #blkcreativesÂ community.

Who I am is a direct reflection of their decision to build a life in the South, and it created my desire to observe the details in all of my surroundings, and ultimately fueled my love for storytelling.\nIâm someone whoâs always been a bit of an outlier in the digital industry, but Twitter has opened the door to opportunities for me, which in turn have allowed me to hold the door open for others. In the middle of the wildest summer ever ââ summer 2020 ââ something even wilder happened. Two of myÂ Tweets were turned into billboardsÂ to support Black Lives Matter. This was already a big deal, but what I didnât expect is how much it raised the visibility of our mission. Now, I know that sounds like a clichÃ©, but during a time of complete lockdown, seeing a physical, tangible statement meant everything to me.\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\nThe response to it was enormous and really served as a proof of concept for me. And because our visibility was raised, it made it easier for people to support our mission of empowering and uplifting Black creatives from a financial, emotional, AND mental standpoint. From that moment we were able to not only donate funds to those in need but we also were able to connect creatives to viable opportunities by way of ourÂ job boardÂ and direct referrals.Â @blkcreativesÂ is so special to our industry because we take every opportunity and resource thatâs given to us, and pour it back into our community in some way. We create with an intention to serve this demographic of Black creatives ââ a demo that is often commodified before they are genuinely supported. Our representation brings our humanity to the forefront. Beyond black squares and diversity and inclusion causes, there are real, actual people who need support and weâre committed to sharing and telling their stories. Context is just as important as content, especially in this digital age.\nTwitter has also allowed us to act as an amplifier for the missions that elevate what really matters. Through creating intentional digital Twitter-only experiences like our infamousÂ Twitter chats. Theyâve literally been the reason why our community has gained so much visibility on Twitter. Once you find a way to nurture your community on Twitter, the possibilities will reveal themselves. Our Twitter chats have also been the key to staying constantly engaged with how our community is feeling and how we can support them.Â \nWhen I think of the stories that reflect our mission, I think aboutÂ Michell Clark. Since 2015, Michell has been a guest at least 3 times for our Twitter chats and our friendship began through this platform. As a writer who writes affirmations for Black creatives, throughÂ our chats and connection on Twitter, weâve been able to watch him continuously reach new heights while empowering us. Or I think aboutÂ Lisa Beasley. Another life-long friend that Iâve met through our Twitter chats. Last November, after witnessing her hilarious Margaret Thatcher impression, I urged her to share it on Twitter and weâd amplify it. The video went viral with millions of views and that moment has led to incredible opportunities for her. I also think aboutÂ Ariana Walton Smith, a content creator who I referred to for a position atÂ We Are Rosie. Through Twitter, We Are RosieâsÂ Kiana PirouzÂ connected with me and the referral not only resulted in a new career level for Ariana but also a valuable team experience for a company doing amazing, necessary work. I also think aboutÂ Nefertiti, a Memphis hair care expert, that I was referred to via Twitter.Â \n@blkcreativesÂ contribution to this industry is best told through the community we serve and their stories. What diversity fails to recognize, is that behind the statistics and data around race, Black creators are real people, with real stories, struggles, experiences, and insight. It doesnât take into account the fullness of our humanity and our range. @blkcreatives is dedicated to translating that value via our stories and the other communities we inspire to do the same. When you inspire @blkcreatives, we pour that into other Black creatives and their ecosystems which strengthen our culture holistically as well as financially and mentally.\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\nThe stories Iâve shared here are just a handful of a much larger collection, and Iâm grateful to be a part of a vision that widely impacts this generation of Black creatives. Twitter allows me to see and leverage that influence on the internet every single day.\nMy hope for Black creatives as they continue to navigate the creative space is that they continue to embrace and own their autonomy and creative freedom, stay connected to strategic resources, take care of themselves, and that they are compensated handsomely for their contributions to culture. I hope that they lead with authenticity vs attention. Attention is fleeting, it lasts a moment, and then itâs taken away by the next craze. Authenticity leads to connection, relationship, and community. Itâs been our primary strategy for garnering support on Twitter and itâs never failed us yet.\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\nMy parents and my community in real life have been a model for what it looks like when trust, compassion, and consideration are established.Â @blkcreativesÂ on Twitter will continue to lead with that in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n    \nMelissa KimbleÂ is a writer, cultural strategist, and founder of #blkcreatives, a digital community that advocates for Black genius across creative industries.\n\n      Follow @Melissa_Kimble\n\n\n=== Building a Twitter community with purpose ===\n\nTWITTER SUPPORT 101\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has all the features you need to help change the game for your own story too:\nShare more with your community throughÂ RetweetsÂ or Quote Tweets.\nJoinÂ conversationsÂ on Twitter.\nThreadÂ your Tweets for maximum impact.\nFind your community throughÂ TopicsÂ andÂ Lists.\nKeep organized and help spread the word by using aÂ hashtag.\nSharing a lot of media with your audience?

Letâs start with a little about you.\n\nI work in gaming, Iâm 30 years old, and Iâve been in the space for about a decade. Iâve been all over the gaming industry, and a passion for learning everything I can has seen my career hop from game development, to the software side, to streaming, and now to esports. Iâve been gaming since I was a kid. In 1996, my dad bought me an N64 for Christmas and I was hooked. My Latinidad and gaming were always intermixed. When my cousins visited from Colombia, they would help me beat Zelda. Iâd show my tios my Pokemon collection. And even during our rehearsal for my QuinceaÃ±era, my friends and I would try to finish early so we could all play Smash Bros together.\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\nWas there a specific experience that highlighted the need for more Latinx representation in the gaming industry?\n\n\nI love marketing and events, but at times, it was difficult to deal with the microaggressions I faced as Latinx and being homesick for a country I couldnât visit often. My heart hurt and I felt unheard. But itâs never been in me to rest or sit still, so I decided to do something about it.\nEvery year, at every convention I went to, I would meet a Latinx person. The reactions would vary: hugging, dancing, or sharing stories of camaraderie, like âOnly Latinx person at your studio too, huh?â These moments were fleeting and would lead to a Twitter connection or maybe a coffee at the next convention, but never something more. I would count on my fingers the number of Latinx folks I knew, and sometimes I counted them when I was frustrated with a work situation or feeling isolated in my Latinidad. I knew there were other Latinx, but I didnât know where I could find them. There werenât many resources for Latinx professionals back then, and I didnât see places for them to interconnect outside of work.\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\nHow did Latinx in Gaming get started?\n\nI startedÂ Latinx in Gaming, as a panel. I invited folks through Twitter to join me at GDC (Game Developers Conference). The panel was an incredible success! All these feelings I had on being lonely, being unseen, and being unheard werenât just shared ââ they were a common experience in the Latinx community. We felt we had to keep that momentum going.Â \nLatinx in Gaming grew. We hosted panels at every convention, we met most of our contacts through conventions or Twitter and kept in touch there. We built out a Discord, a Facebook page, a LinkedIN. We kept speaking publicly, kept talking to our people, and kept asking other Latinx professionals to share their stories.\nÂ \nWeâre so glad you turned to Twitter to createÂ @latinosingaming! Were there any particular strategies you used to build up the community?\n\nHonestly, our strategy was a couple different pieces. Firstly, we consistently asked our audience to share with us other Latinx folks of note. âGive us women in the space you admire, tell us people who uplift you.â We would follow those folks or message them. Anytime we put on an event, weâd Tweet that we want volunteers, usually with a form. Weâve developed our network overtime this way. Thereâs still a ton of folks we havenât reached, but Twitter helped us grow from 5 followers to 5,000. Finally, it was important to be unafraid to share voices. When we first started out, we tried to avoid âspammingâ the timeline. But we realized that by Retweeting Latinx folks, and Retweeting responses to us, we were building an audience and giving folks a platform to see and find each other. We were a mouthpiece and it was okay to be loud.\nÂ \nDo you have a go-to Twitter feature(s) you love to use?\n\nWe loveÂ scheduling Tweets. We do a lot of things throughout the months that show off Latinx voices and having it all scheduled out in advance helps us be organized and makes our Tweets look super polished.\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\nIs there a story from the Latinx in Gaming community thatâs close to your heart?\n\nLast year, we heldÂ Unidos Online, a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration with over 60 pieces of content going live. We TweetedÂ ListsÂ upon Lists of developers to follow, we uplifted folks who were looking to hire, we uplifted folks looking for a job. For us, Twitter was the mouthpiece, the platform that we yelled from the rooftops that we existed. We werenât afraid toÂ RetweetÂ often ââ sometimes even daily. And sometimes get hate, but thatâs okay, we exist within a diverse space and weâre doing our best.\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\nWhat has been the most rewarding part of your work with @latinosingaming?\n\nWe provide a home for people. People can be themselves here, people can be their version of Latinx/Latine/Latino here and to us thatâs important. We want to celebrate the beauty of how complex our history and our story is and Latinx in Gaming helps us with that.Â \nFor us, Latinx in Gaming is a platform on which we raise all the different beautiful and unique Latinx stories. And weâve got many more stories to tell.\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Amplifying Latinx representation, one Tweet at a time ===\n\nThanks for joining us for this interview!

It's the platform that houses all the discussions, updates and news in the Gaming industry, but also allows you to express your personality.Â \nGaming is...interesting. Since a young age, Iâve enjoyed escaping to various fantasy worlds but it was always a matter of time until I was brought back to reality. When I was young, it was in the form of absence of Black women characters ââ one or two would grace the screen but as stereotypes that were so predictable, bland, and offensive. Now donât get me wrong, I didnât expect Black women to be in Crash Bandicoot (a game about a spinning marsupial), but our appearances were so far and few between that, at one point, I believed gaming to be a completely white male hobby.Â\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\nWhen online gaming arrived, it brought along with it another forum for white male gamers to flex their colonial attitudes towards anything they deem of value; once again taking me out of the fantasy world and into reality. And when gaming conversations were born online, they brought that toxicity with them. I grew tired and stopped gaming online for years, but after seeing some male âfriendsâ from university create their own gaming channels with truly mediocre content and borderline offensive commentary ââ I started my own channel along with my personal Twitter page.\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\nThough I abandoned my gaming channel endeavours to focus on creatingÂ Black Girl Gamers, it was via myÂ personal Twitter pageÂ that I met friends likeÂ @ljay90, most likely via hashtags likeÂ #blackgamers, who in turn introduced me to fellow Black women gamers such asÂ @junaebenne,Â @chasinglux, andÂ @astylishjediÂ (who still helps manage our Twitter page) who later became the first Community Management team for Black Girl Gamers. They, like myself, felt either annoyed, ostracised, invisible, undervalued or needed camaraderie.\nIf Iâm being honest, I was bored of some of the conversations about race and gaming that I saw online. They were so frequently rooted in assimilation or fear of rocking developersâ boats. I felt concessions were made on the behalf of Black gamers to comfort developer fragility that would hold us back in the long run. Ultimately, something was missing from these discussions, and in hindsight itâs only now that I realise it was the vim. To be vocal online meant braving a tidal wave of whitesplaining, mansplaining, or racist responses. I wantedÂ Black Girl GamersÂ to contribute positively to the narrative so I created the Twitter handle. Having a Twitter page brought visibility to our experiences and opinions to many, including those who disagreed with our Tweets. But, it isnât always serious stuff, I love to crack jokes and often make threads such as âIf BeyoncÃ© were a Fantasy RPG characterâ because there was an unspoken feeling that Black pop culture was juxtaposed to gaming culture at times.\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\nOver time,Â Black Girl GamersÂ grew into a bastion for Black women in the industry, whether or not they were a part of our private community. We brought a new lease of life to Diversity & Inclusion narratives in the industry via our vocality and the feeling that âenough was enoughâ. We interact with our followers on Twitter, especially our Black women followers because they are the ones who need to be heard and seen the most. They in turn joined theÂ conversationÂ andÂ RetweetedÂ us, sending our message out into their own personal communities ââ a great feature of Twitter. Interacting with our supporters comes naturally. We chat, ask them to teach us, we boost Tweets for good causes, and share jokes with our supporters ââ weâre human and itâs important to come across as that. This allows us to offer a safe space for discourse (even out in the open).\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\nDiversity and inclusion wasnât as âtrendyâ as it is now and so at times, when Tweeting, I had to step into that âangry Black womanâ label that would be frequently attached to Black Girl Gamers but I didnât care. It took thick skin but before I knew it, Retweets on our Tweets calling out publishers would spread our message and our Tweets would often, and still do, have a seat at the table in rooms full of professionals that were too scared to actually speak to or employ Black women directly. Black women from all over the world have come to feel seen by reading our Tweets and appreciate the authenticity in our purpose. We spark and join discussions up until the point of exhaustion or our point being made. And because of this, we still receive messages of thanks for bringing issues to the forefront and using representation in games as the entry point to incite change.Â Â \nTwitter is a key part of our strategies for Black Girl Gamers. We receive our best analytics from Twitter, which is due to the massive gamer audience on the platform and the speed at which conversation can spark. The capability to post links in Tweets when promoting events such as our Black Girl Gamers Online Summit and streams with brands like Fortnite, is invaluable to us as a platform. When there are down days (fighting the good fight gets tiring), we Retweet successful content from the past using TwitterâsÂ Media Studio LibraryÂ or spark lighthearted discussions with our supporters.Â Pinning our TweetsÂ keeps our followers up to date on whatâs most important.\nThe visibility ofÂ Black Girl GamersÂ has gone through the roof and we still have a way to go. Various members have found us via Twitter to become esteemed and valued members of our Community Management, Stream, or Twitch team. But the visibility isnât restricted to just Black women gamers ââ I once sat in awe of the growth and also our list of verified followers; a far cry from starting a Twitter page to pop off at the industry. Being verified on the platform has also validated our experiences; itâs shown that weâre not to be overlooked in the industry as we were before.\nOur voice has weight.\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\n\n\n\n=== How Black Girl Gamers used Twitter to change the game ===\n\nOur goal is to continue driving change in various areas of gaming; character representation, workforce diversity, inclusion and equity; and become the beacon of Black girl magic that changed the industry for good. Weâll continue to use Twitter to aid us in our events, workshops, initiatives, and opinions in order to make that change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n    \nJay-Ann is the CEO and Founder ofÂ Black Girl Gamersâ¢; an online safe space and platform that heightens the visibility of Black Women in Gaming and advocates for Diversity & Inclusion.

En nuestra comunidad y en nuestra cultura la tradiciÃ³n oral (a la que yo prefiero llamar tradiciÃ³n mnemÃ³nica porque su soporte es la memoria) las palabras son muy importantes. Una gran parte del trabajo cotidiano en nuestros hogares se acompaÃ±a de una buena plÃ¡tica en mixe, mi lengua materna, en la que abundan anÃ©cdotas, historias, preguntas y risas. Ahora que llevo unos aÃ±os de haber regresado a vivir en mi comunidad, una de las actividades que mÃ¡s he extraÃ±ado es platicar con personas que estÃ¡n lejos geogrÃ¡ficamente.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nEn febrero de 2010, hace diez aÃ±os, abrÃ­ mi cuenta de Twitter, al principio sÃ³lo leÃ­ algunas cosas y despuÃ©s abandonÃ© la plataforma por mucho tiempo. Sin embargo, poco tiempo despuÃ©s, mi cuenta comenzÃ³ a ser para mÃ­ un espacio en el que sentÃ­ que podrÃ­a seguir ejercitando el intercambio de palabras y conversaciones que es una actividad muy importante para mÃ­.Â  PodÃ­a ponerme a platicar con amigos que se encuentran en otro lugar, personas a las que nunca he conocido fÃ­sicamente, personas con las que puedo tener afinidades o incluso con otras con las que tengo abiertas y confrontantes diferencias. En Twitter podÃ­a tambiÃ©n plantear ideas de procesos en los que estoy involucrada en la vida real como la lucha por la preservaciÃ³n de la diversidad lingÃ¼Ã­stica: para ello utilicÃ© Twitter para escribir en mi lengua y dar cuenta de la diversidad en el mundo.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nCuentas comoÂ @ActLenguasÂ oÂ @IndigenousTweet, por mencionar sÃ³lo un par de ejemplos de los cientos que hay, realizan una gran labor de divulgaciÃ³n de la diversidad lingÃ¼Ã­stica y me inspirado en ellos. Mi actividad, en ese entonces, se centraba sobre todo en estos temas que me interesan y preocupan. Lamentablemente, en mayo y junio del aÃ±o 2017, algo muy lamentable sucediÃ³ en mi comunidad, un grupo violento nos atacÃ³ y nos despojÃ³ del manantial del que mi comunidad habÃ­a tomado agua potable histÃ³ricamente. Nuestra infraestructura hidrÃ¡ulica, construida con trabajo comunitario, fue completamente destruida; aunado a eso, muchas personas fueron heridas y varias mujeres fueron secuestradas.\nToda la comunidad quedÃ³ afectada aunque particularmente la poblaciÃ³n infantil y de la tercera edad. La bÃºsqueda de justicia por estos hechos y la necesidad de volver a ser conectados a nuestro manantial fue larga y a travÃ©s de distintos medios. La denuncia en Twitter a travÃ©s de los perfiles de las personas que pertenecemos a la comunidad fue uno de esos medios, desde mi cuenta fui narrando las injusticias que estÃ¡bamos sufriendo y denunciando las amenazas que recibimos cotidianamente. Muchas personas a las que conocÃ­ virtualmente a travÃ©s de Twitter comenzaron a preguntarme sobre lo que estaba sucediendo en mi comunidad, para conjuntar este tema, comencÃ© a utilizar elÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ pues la situaciÃ³n se tornaba cada vez mÃ¡s difÃ­cil.\nA principios de mayo de 2019,Â  a punto de que mi comunidad cumpliera dos aÃ±os sin acceso al agua potable, la escritora mexicana Gabriela JaÃºregui, impulsÃ³,Â  junto a muchas mujeres, la denuncia de la situaciÃ³n en la que se encontraba mi comunidad. Lo que sucediÃ³ inmediatamente despuÃ©s fue impresionante, muchÃ­simas cuentas de personas de muy diverso perfil comenzaron a usar elÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ para ayudar a presionar a las autoridades encargadas de hacer justicia, miles de personas, entre ellas escritores, activistas por los derechos humanos yÂ  periodistas de diferentes medios, se unieron a nuestra causa y a nuestra voz. Derivado de ello, las autoridades locales aceptaron una interlocuciÃ³n con nuestra comunidad y nos hemos sentido mÃ¡s acompaÃ±ados en el proceso de bÃºsqueda de justicia.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nDesde entonces, elÂ Â #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ ha mantenido viva la conversaciÃ³n sobre el tema de la violaciÃ³n del derecho humano al agua en nuestra comunidad y ha acompaÃ±ado nuestra lucha pacÃ­fica para conseguir justicia. Con el comienzo de la pandemia de COVID-19, la necesidad del agua se volviÃ³ aÃºn mÃ¡s imperante dado que el agua es fundamental para el lavado de manos y asÃ­ lo hemos denunciado tambiÃ©n en Twitter.\nDesgraciadamente, aÃºn no hemos podido lograr la reconexiÃ³n a nuestro manantial a pesar de que un juez federal nos ha dado la razÃ³n en el Ã¡rea legal pero la lucha continÃºa. Por medio delÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ informo cotidianamente sobre las noticias y el progreso de nuestro proceso y por medio de Ã©l, las personas nos ayudan a denunciar que en Ayutla nos sigue haciendo falta el agua. Un ejemplo de esta solidaridad continua es la manera en la que, desde diversas cuentas de Twitter como la de Isaura Leonardo, amigas y amigos comprometidos con nuestra lucha (@LeonardoIsaura,Â @darkolina,Â @el_nomad_cook) el 15 abril de 2020,Â  se organizÃ³ una convocatoria dirigida a dibujantes e ilustradores para crear dibujos e ilustraciones para exigirÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYa.\nEsta convocatoria tuvo como resultado mÃ¡s de cien ilustraciones pidiendo justicia y agua para nuestra comunidad y su impacto fue tal que llegÃ³ a diversos medios de comunicaciÃ³n comoÂ El UniversalÂ yÂ La Jornada. A travÃ©s de mi cuenta he dado a conocer lo agradecidos que estamos en nuestra comunidad por todo este gran apoyo que personas que, aunque no conocemos fÃ­sicamente, nos han ayudado aÂ  denunciar pÃºblicamente la situaciÃ³n que atravesamos. Todo su respaldo y apoyo hace que confiemos en que pronto nuestra voz, amplificada con la voz de muchas personas en Twitter, serÃ¡ escuchada por fin y nuestro derecho de acceso al agua serÃ¡ restablecido.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nHablar virtualmente de estos temas tan importantes y tristes para nosotros con mÃ¡s personas que nos apoyan en nuestra denuncia a travÃ©s de una plataforma como Twitter y por medio delÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYa, nos anima a continuar luchando.Â \n\nMuchÃ­simas gracias por eso.\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      SOBRE LA AUTORA\n    \nYÃ¡snaya Elena Aguilar GilÂ (Ayutla Mixe, 1981) is part of COLMIX, a group of young Mixes that carries out research and dissemination activities on Mixe language, history and culture.

In our community and in our culture, oral tradition is extremely important. (Side note: I prefer to call it âmnemonic tradition,â because its support is derived from memory.)Â \nAn important element of the daily work in my home is good conversation in my mother tongue, Mixe. These precious conversations are where anecdotes, stories, questions, and laughter abound. And now that Iâve been back living in my community for the last few years, one of the activities Iâve missed the most is speaking with people who are geographically far away.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nTen years ago, I signed up for Twitter. At first, I only spent a little time on the platform and then I left for a while. However, I soon realized that my Twitter account was a space for me to continue exercising in the exchange of words and conversations. This is a vital activity for me. Twitter was and is where I can talk to friends who are elsewhere, with people I have never physically met, and with people I may have affinities with. And even others with whom I have open and confronting differences with. On Twitter, I can also raise ideas around the activism in which Iâm involved, such as the fight for the preservation of linguistic diversity. For this in particular, I use Twitter to write in my native language and to share an account of the beautiful diversity in our world.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nAccounts likeÂ @ActLenguasÂ andÂ @IndigenousTweetÂ are just a couple of examples out of hundreds of accounts that do an amazing job of disseminating linguistic diversity. Iâm inspired by them. My activism used to focus on all the issues that interested and concerned me. But then in May and June 2017, something very horrific happened in my community. A violent group attacked us and deprived us of the spring from which my community had historically used for drinking water. Our hydraulic infrastructure ââ built through community work ââ was completely destroyed. In addition to that, many people were injured and several women were kidnapped.\nOur entire community was affected, but particularly children and the elderly.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nThe search for justice for these events and the need to be reconnected to our water source has been a long and painful one. For those of us affected in our community, using Twitter to get the word out was vital.\n\n\nYÃ¡snaya Elena Aguilar Gil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nFrom my own account I was narrating the injustices that we were suffering and denouncing the threats we received on a daily basis. Many people I met virtually on Twitter asked me about what was happening in my community, and how they could help. So I began to useÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ (Water For Ayutla Already) as the situation became increasingly difficult.\n\nIn May 2019, my community was going on two years without access to drinking water. Gabriela JaÃºregui, a Mexican writer, along with countless women, helped to actively denounce the situation affecting my community. What happened immediately afterwards was impressive: many Twitter accounts from people with incredibly diverse profiles began usingÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ to help put pressure on the authorities in charge of delivering justice to our community. Thousands of people, including writers, human rights activists, and journalists from different media outlets, joined our cause. And our voice. As a result, the local authorities accepted an interlocution with our community. Since then we have felt more seen in the process of seeking justice.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n#AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ has kept the conversation alive around the basic human right to accessing water in our community, and has accompanied our peaceful struggle to achieve justice. Additionally, as we all were confronted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we used Twitter to demand the need for water even louder as water is essential for proper hand washing.\nUnfortunately, we have not yet been able to reconnect to our source despite the fact that a federal judge has agreed with us in legal terms. Nonetheless, our fight continues. ThroughÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYaÂ I report daily on the news and our progress and through it, people help us to denounce and spread the word that Ayutla still needs water. Our Twitter solidarity is constant, however. We see accounts such asÂ @LeonardoIsaura,Â @darkolina, andÂ @el_nomad_cookÂ committed to and Tweeting about our struggle.\nA notable Twitter movement from them was on April 15, 2020 ââ where a call for artists and illustrators to create drawings and illustrations went out to demandÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYa. This call resulted in more than 100 illustrations demanding justice and water for our community and its impact was so tremendous that it caught the attention of various media outlets, such asÂ El UniversalÂ andÂ La Jornada. Through my Twitter account, I have expressed how grateful we are in our community. All of this amazing support from people we donât personally know offline, yet they've helped us to publicly denounce this horrific situation we are going through.\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Conversations on Twitter about the right to water ===\n\nAll of the continued support you have shown us makes us confident that soon our voice ââ amplified by the voices of so many people on Twitter ââ will finally be truly heard and our right to access to water will be restored. Talking virtually about these important and sad issues for us with more people who support us through a platform like Twitter, and throughÂ #AguaParaAyutlaYa, encourages us to continue fighting.\n\nThank you very much for that.\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n    \nYÃ¡snaya Elena Aguilar GilÂ (Ayutla Mixe, 1981) is part of COLMIX, a group of young Mixes that carries out research and dissemination activities on Mixe language, history and culture.

This series includes interviews, use-cases, and real-talk explanations of our rules, enforcement, and how real people use our platform and elevate it. #TwitterVoices: With Our Words aims to increase advocacy through greater understanding and empathy across a wide-spectrum of accounts, hashtags, and communities.\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\nWhen New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and issued a stay-at-home order, I, like many other Americans, went shopping to stockpile food and necessities. As I saw lines grow and shelves emptied, I decided to make purchases not only for myself, but for my mother and sister. But as I waited for the cashier to bag my items, I thought of the many individuals who did not have the cash on hand to buy items before they were sold out. Or those who did not have a family member to go shopping for them.\nÂ\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\nIt quickly became apparent that COVID-19, like racism, was a virus that was going to disproportionately impact poor and Black and brown communities.\n\n\nZellie Imani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\nÂ \nGovernor Phil Murphyâs stay-at-home order was an important executive order to stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus. But while it may have prevented many from suffering symptoms of COVID-19, it did not prevent communities already suffering from food insecurity. If the goal was for the most vulnerable population to survive the pandemic through self-quarantine, how could they survive if they could not leave their homes to retrieve the groceries, medicine, and necessities to sustain themselves?\nÂ \nAround this time, I began seeing activists on my Twitter timeline share sign up sheets to join mutual aid neworks. These networks were quickly popping up all over the country. They were self-organized groups of people sharing resources and supporting neighbors who needed help to survive the pandemic. Recognizing the value in these forms, I did what all good organizers do: I copied it.\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\nAs the threat of food insecurity grew, a local IHOP reached out to me, seeking to donate breakfasts. I contacted a local senior home to see if they were able and willing to accept the food donations. I delivered 25 breakfasts for a few days until a senior asked, âAre you doing dinner, too?â I said, âSure.â And now, we are delivering 200 dinners, 3 days a week to seniors throughout the city of Paterson.\nAs the demand for the resource grew, so did the need for additional help and funds. By sharing pictures, videos, and our journey onÂ Twitter, we began to raise enough money to both expand and continue our operation. People enjoyed the behind the scenes footage of prepping the food and pictures of the seniors we delivered to. We relied heavily on others seeing and sharing our Tweets to raise money to sustain our mutual aid. Posting on Twitter allowed us to garner support from outside our local community, and it quickly became noticed by media outlets who went on to cover our work.\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Using Twitter to tell it ===\n\nBut posting on Twitter wasnât simply a way to gain exposure. Twitter has always been a platform to share your life and thoughts with others. There were hundreds of new infections in my city.Â Dozens of new deaths. Myself and my team constantly feared we would be next. We shared the good. But we also shared the bad. We constantly discussed shutting down the operation. But each day, we found ourselves back at the restaurant preparing to deliver to seniors that we began to develop bonds with.\nLike the one senior who told me they needed supplies. I called to tell her I purchased them. While on the call she told me she hadnât been able to get her medicine. I told her Iâll pick it up. She said she wanted to hug me, but she canât.\nMoments like this meant something to me. But as I shared these moments on Twitter, I learned that it meant something to others as well. It was these moments that were connecting me to strangers online, not simply mutual followers. Twitter is a platform that allows us to share our stories, so my advice to others is, âTell it.â\nOur efforts taught us that community isnât simply about living in proximity to someone, but supporting a fellow human being in times of need. Before the pandemic, many of us had online networks, the pandemic transformed it into online communities. Community is a verb. Community is how we will get through this.\nCommunity is how we will get free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n    \n\nZellie ImaniÂ is a writer, educator, and organizer.

Minha avÃ³ me ensinava a ler, minha mÃ£e dizia o tempo todo o quanto eu era inteligente e especial. Eu corria e ria com as minhas primas e me sentia importante. Minha vida era importante, o que eu pensava era importante e aprender mais para poder pensar mais era estimulado todos os dias.\nOs livros faziam parte de todos os aspectos do meu cotidiano. Tinha livro em todos os lugares da minha casa. Livros de adultos, livros de crianÃ§as, livros sobre como as coisas funcionam e livros com histÃ³rias sobre a beleza do mundo. Aprendi meu nome na capa de um desses muitos livros que tinha na minha casa e circundava meu cotidiano. Foi na capa da autobiografia de Winnie Mandela, que reconheci meu nome e a mim mesma.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nContudo, os impactos do racismo no mundo lÃ¡ fora, nÃ£o possibilitavam que minha mÃ£e e minha vÃ³ me protegessem da violÃªncia racial. Fui para escola e quase sempre era a Ãºnica crianÃ§a negra da minha sala de aula, as vezes a Ãºnica crianÃ§a negra da escola inteira e o que antes era celebraÃ§Ã£o passou a ser violÃªncia. As brincadeiras racistas dos colegas foram ficando mais frequentes, eu comecei a duvidar de que era inteligente, especial, bonita e importante. Essa violÃªncia racial na escola podia ter significado o meu silencio, poderia ter significado a inviabilidade das minhas potencialidades intelectuais, poderia ter significado o fim do florescimento de uma consciÃªncia polÃ­tica feminista negra, mas graÃ§as aos livros que circundavam a minha casa, a experiÃªncia da violÃªncia racial desde a mais tenra idade me deu a noÃ§Ã£o de que precisaria resistir.Â \nÂ\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nE para resistir eu precisava ler.\n\n\nWinnie Bueno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nÂ \nToda vez que eu era violentada racialmente na escola, minha vÃ³ me lembrava que o conhecimento Ã© uma das poucas coisas na vida que ninguÃ©m pode tirar da gente. Por isso, eu tinha pressa para ler. Lia todos os livros que minha mÃ£e trazia, todos os livros da biblioteca da escola, todos os livros que paravam na minha mÃ£o. Eu lia e minha avÃ³ lia comigo, depois a gente discutia as histÃ³rias. Minha avÃ³ me ensinou sobre a importÃ¢ncia de nÃ£o deixar ninguÃ©m controlar a nossa prÃ³pria narrativa a partir das conversas sobre as histÃ³rias que lÃ­amos juntas. Todos os dias eu aprendia uma coisa nova que me ajudava a resistir e todos os dias os livros me proporcionaram pequenas revoluÃ§Ãµes.\nLer tanto, me proporcionou escrever e nomear minhas prÃ³prias experiÃªncias. Nomear as minhas prÃ³prias experiÃªncias proporcionou uma compreensÃ£o mais ampla sobre as formas de manifestaÃ§Ã£o do racismo, sobre os estereÃ³tipos que sÃ£o articulados para manter pessoas negras em lugares de subordinaÃ§Ã£o, sobre as ideologias racistas e sobre as hierarquias que o racismo articula. A leitura me possibilitou conhecimento autÃ´nomo, o conhecimento autÃ´nomo blindou meu intelecto de ser desconstituÃ­do pelas lÃ³gicas da violÃªncia racista epistÃªmica que atravessa os processos de educaÃ§Ã£o institucional. A leitura me possibilitou usar a escrita para refletir minha prÃ³pria vez, e oÂ TwitterÂ foi a ferramenta onde consegui dizer o que penso e como penso para muitas pessoas ao mesmo tempo.\nEscrever no TwitterÂ sobre meu cotidiano, meus estudos, minhas impressÃµes sobre a sociedade fizeram com que eu constituÃ­sse uma rede com milhares de pessoas. O exercÃ­cio da influÃªncia no Twitter, entretanto, precisava servir para um propÃ³sito maior que a repercussÃ£o da minha prÃ³pria voz. Eu precisava agir de forma a compartilhar as pequenas revoluÃ§Ãµes que os livros me proporcionavam.\nNo dia 20 de novembro de 2018, Dia da ConsciÃªncia Negra no Brasil, a partir de um simples Tweet, eu iniciei uma rede de compartilhamento de livros para pessoas negras. Tudo comeÃ§ou com uma simples sugestÃ£o:Â ei, pessoas brancas! Que tal FAZER algo para contribuir na luta contra o racismo ao invÃ©s de apenas se auto congratular por se anunciar enquanto antirracista? Que tal doar um livro para uma pessoa negra que precisa de um livro e nÃ£o pode comprar?\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nA primeira pessoa a aceitar esse pedido foi Rosana Pinheiro-Machado, uma importante intelectual internacional e tambÃ©m minha grande amiga. Rosana enviou livros para muitos jovens negros que solicitaram livros. Ela compartilhou a experiÃªncia em seu prÃ³prio perfil. As doacoes dela ajudaram pessoas como Gabriela Moura, uma mulher negra sensacional que tem uma experiencia incrivel em compartilhar conhecimento e suas prÃ³prias opiniÃµes em redes sociais.Â \nDa primeira doacao atÃ© agora, a rede que eu estabeleci se tornou mais relevante e impactou mais pessoas. Pessoas que doaram e pessoas que receberam livros. NÃ³s temos o apoio de pessoas como Emicida, um importante rapper brasileiro, e Gilberto Gil, um dos mais importantes artistas na histÃ³ria da mÃºsica brasileira. NÃ³s compartilhamos livros de editoras que nos auxiliam, compartilhamos livros de pessoas do mundo inteiro que compreendem o impacto do racismo no Brasil e como o racismo influencia na educacao. NÃ³s compartilhamos a dÃ¡diva que eu recebi desde que era crianca.Â\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nCom essa sugestÃ£o dei inÃ­cio a uma rede que conecta pessoas atravÃ©s de livros, aÂ Winnieteca. A Winnieteca Ã© umÂ chatbotÂ dentro do Twitter onde pessoas negras que precisam de um livro registram o livro que precisam e pessoas que podem doar um livro que uma pessoa negra precisa se inscrevem para adotar um pedido. A Winnieteca comecou com um simples tweet mas se sustenta atravÃ©s das utopias de um futuro onde o acesso ao conhecimento e as ferramentas que o aprimoram, como os livros, sejam possÃ­veis para qualquer pessoa, em qualquer lugar. Um futuro onde o racismo nÃ£o seja uma barreira no aprimoramento de nossos conhecimentos.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nO Twitter Ã© a ferramenta que possibilitou transformar essas trocas em uma tecnologia para emancipaÃ§Ã£o e autonomia. Possibilita que crianÃ§as, jovens e adultos possam acessar os recursos da literatura e da pesquisa, mas acima de tudo, o afeto que circula com os livros que sÃ£o enviados pela Winnieteca me permite manter e compartilhar os aprendizados que minha vÃ³ me ensinou.Â \nConhecimento Ã© a Ãºnica coisa que ninguÃ©m pode te tirar.Â \nE tambÃ©m Ã© a coisa mais preciosa que vocÃª pode oferecer para alguÃ©m.\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      SOBRE O AUTOR\n    \nWinnieÂ Ã© orgulhosamente uma iyalorixÃ¡ negra.

My grandmother taught me how to read, my mother said all the time how smart and special I was. I played and laughed with my sister and my cousins ââand I felt important. My life was important, what I thought was important, and learning more and thinking more was encouraged every day.\nBooks were a part of every aspect of my daily life. There was a book everywhere in my house. Adult books, children's books, books about how things work, and books with stories about the beauty of the world. I even learned my name from the cover of one of those many books: Winnie Mandelaâs autobiography,Â Part of My Soul. It was on that cover that I recognized my name and myself.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nAnd yet, the impacts of racism on the outside world did not allow my mother and grandmother to protect me from racial violence. I went to school and was almost always the only Black child in my classroomââsometimes the only Black child in the entire school. What used to be celebration, became violence. The racist jokes of colleagues became more frequent, and so I started to doubt that I was smart, special, beautiful, and important. This racial violence at school could have meant my silence, it could have meant the infeasibility of my intellectual potentials, it could have meant the end of the flourishing of a Black feminist political conscience, but thanks to the books that had surrounded me in my house, the experience of racial violence from an early age gave me the strength that I would need to resist.\nÂ\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nAnd in order to resist I would need to read.\n\n\nWinnie Bueno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nÂ \nWhenever I was hurt at school, my grandmother reminded me that knowledge is one of the few things in life that no one can take away from us. And thatâs why I had an urge to read. I read all the books my mother bought, all the books in the school library, all the books that I could get my hands on. I read and my grandmother read with me. Then weâd discuss the stories. My grandmother has taught me the importance of not letting anyone control our own narrative from conversations weâd have about the stories we had read together. Every day I learned something new to help me resist and every day those books gave me small revolutions.\n\nReading so much, allowed me to write and name my own experiences. Naming my own experiences has provided a broader understanding of the ways in which racism manifests itself, the stereotypes that are articulated to keep Black people in places of subordination, racist ideologies, and the hierarchies that racism articulates. Reading enabled me to have autonomous knowledge. A knowledge that shielded my intellect from being deconstructed by the logic of epistemic racist violence deep-rooted in the processes of institutional education. Reading made it possible for me to use writing to reflect my own experiences.\nAndÂ TwitterÂ was the tool where I was able to say what I think and how I think to many people at the same time.\nTweetingÂ about my daily life, my studies, and my impressions of society made me form a network with thousands of people. The exercise of influence on Twitter, however, needed to serve a purpose greater than the repercussion of my own voice. I needed to act in order to share the small revolutions that books gave me.Â \nOn November 20, 2018, Black Awareness Day in Brazil, from a simpleÂ Tweet, I started a book sharing network for Black people. It all started with a simple suggestion:Â You know what would be cool to celebrate Black Conscious Day? You, a white privileged person who self congratulates yourself for advertising as an anti-racist, donating a book to a Black person who needs a book and can't buy it.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nThe first person to attend my request was Rosana Pinheiro-Machado, an important international intellectual and also my great friend. Rosana sent books to many young Afro-Brazilan who requested. And she shared her experience on her own profile. Her donations helped people like Gabriela Moura, an amazing Black woman with incredible experience in sharing knowledge and important opinions online.Â \nWith these first donations until now, this network that Iâd established became more relevant and impacted more peopleââfrom the people who donated to the people who received books. Weâve had support from people like Emicida, a really famous rapper in Brazil, and Gilberto Gil, one of the most important artists in Brazilian musical history. We share books from publishers that help us, we share books from people all around the world who understand the impact of racism in Brazil, and how racism influences educational institutions. We share the gift that I've received since I was young.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nFrom a suggestion, I started a network that connects people through books: theÂ Winnieteca.Â \nWinnieteca is a Twitter Direct MessageÂ chatbotÂ where Black people who need a book register for the book they need. Then, whoever can donate to the person in need, does so. Winnieteca drives the network of affection and circulation of knowledge that I started with one Tweet, but itâs sustained by the utopia of a future where access to knowledge and tools to enhance that knowledgeââsuch as booksââare possible for everyone, everywhere. A future where racism is not a barrier to gain knowledge.\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Get to know Winnieteca ===\n\nTwitter made it possible to transform these exchanges into a technology for emancipation and autonomy. It allows children, young people, and adults to access the resources of literature and research, but above all, the affection that circulates with the books that are sent by Winnieteca allows me to maintain and share the lessons that my grandmother passed on to me.\nKnowledge is the only thing that no one can take away from you.\nAnd it is the most precious thing you can offer to someone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n    \nWinnieÂ is an IyalorixÃ¡ and a proud Afro-Brazilian woman.

You should also create an equally strong and unique password for the email address associated with your Twitter account.\nDoâs:\nDoÂ create a password at least 10 characters long. Longer is better.DoÂ use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.DoÂ use a different password for each website you visit.DoÂ keep your password in a safe place. Consider using password management software to store all of your login information securely.\nDonâts:\nDo notÂ use personal information in your password such as phone numbers, birthdays, etc.Do notÂ use common dictionary words such as âpasswordâ, âiloveyouâ, etc.Do notÂ use sequences such as âabcd1234â, or keyboard sequences like âqwerty.âDo notÂ reuse passwords across websites. Your Twitter account password should be unique to Twitter.\nAdditionally, you can selectÂ Password reset protectionÂ in yourÂ AccountÂ settings. If you check this box, you will be prompted to enter either your email address or phone number, or your email address then phone number if both are associated with your account to send a reset password link or confirmation code if you ever forget it.Â \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How to find your password reset settings\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your main menuTap Settings and privacyTap AccountTap SecurityToggle on Password reset protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your App SettingsTap AccountTap SecurityToggle Password reset protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse two-factor authenticationâ¨â¨\nTwo-factor authentication is an extra layer of security for your account. Instead of relying on a password only, two-factor authentication introduces a second check to help make sure that you, and only you, can access your Twitter account. Only people who have access to both your password and your mobile phone (or a security key) will be able to log in to your account.\nRead our article on two-factor authentication to learn more.â¨â¨\nCheck that you're on twitter.comâ¨ â¨\nPhishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving up your Twitter username, email address or phone number and password, usually so they can send out spam from your account. Often, theyâll try to trick you with a link that goes to a fake login page. Whenever you are prompted to enter your Twitter password, take a quick look at the URL in the address bar of your browser to make sure you're on twitter.com. Additionally, if you receive a Direct Message (even from a friend) with a URL that looks odd, we recommend you do not open the link.\nPhishing websites will often look just like Twitter's login page, but will actually be a website that is not Twitter. Twitter domains will always have https://twitter.com/ as the base domain. Here are some examples of Twitter login pages:â¨\nÂ https://twitter.comâ¨Â https://twitter.com/login\nIf you are ever unsure about a login page, go directly to twitter.com and enter your credentials there. If you think you may have been phished, change your password as soon as possible and visit our compromised account article for additional instructions.Â \nRead about fake Twitter emails for more information about phishing through email.Â  â¨â¨\nWe won't contact you asking for your passwordâ¨â¨\nTwitter will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.\nWe will never ask you to download something or sign-in to a non-Twitter website. Never open an attachment or install any software from an email that claims to be from us; it's not.â¨\nIf we suspect your account has been phished or hacked, we may reset your password to prevent the hacker from misusing your account. In this case, we'll email you a twitter.com password reset link.â¨\nIf you forget your password, you can reset it via this link.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNew and suspicious login alerts\n\n\nIf we detect a suspicious login or when you log in to your Twitter account from a new device for the first time, we will send you a push notificationÂ within the Twitter app, or via email as an extra layer of security for your account. Login alerts are only sent following new logins through Twitter for iOS and Android, twitter.com, and mobile web.\nThrough these alerts, you can verify that it was you who logged in from the device. If you did not log in from the device, you should follow the steps in the notification to secure your account, starting by changing your Twitter password immediately. Please note that the location listed in the notification is an approximate location derived from the IP address you used to access Twitter, and it may be different from your physical location.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you log in to your Twitter account from incognito browsers or browsers with cookies disabled, you will receive an alert each time.\n\n\n\n\nEmail address update alerts\n\n\nAny time the email address associated with your Twitter account is changed, we will send an email notification to the previously-used email address on your account. In the event your account is compromised, these alerts will help you take steps to regain control of your account.\nÂ \nEvaluating links on Twitter\n\n\nMany Twitter users post links using URL shorteners, like bit.ly or TinyURL, to create unique, shortened links that are easier to share in Tweets. However, URL shorteners can obscure the end domain, making it difficult to tell where the link goes to.\nSome browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, have free plug-ins that will show you the extended URLs without you having to click on them:\n\nURL Expanders for Chrome\nURL Expanders for Firefox\nIn general, please use caution when clicking on links. If you click on a link and find yourself unexpectedly on a page that resembles the Twitter login page, do not enter your username and password. Instead, go to twitter.com and log in directly from the Twitter homepage.\nÂ \nKeep your computer and browser up-to-date and virus-free\n\n\nKeep your browser and operating system updated with the most current versions and patchesâpatches are often released to address particular security threats. Be sure to also scan your computer regularly for viruses, spyware, and adware.\nIf you're using a public computer, make sure you sign out of Twitter when you're done.\n\n\nSelect third-party applications with care\n\n\nThere are many third-party applications built on the Twitter platform by external developers that you can use with your Twitter account(s). However, you should be cautious before giving third-party applications access to your account.\nIf you wish to grant a third-party application access to your account, we recommend that you only do so using Twitterâs OAuth method. OAuth is a secure connection method and doesnât require you to give your Twitter username and password to the third party. You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give your username and password to an application or website, as third-party applications donât need your username and password to be granted access to your account via Oauth. When you give your username and password to someone else, they have complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended. Learn about connecting or revoking third-party applications.\n\nWe suggest you review third-party applications that have access to your account from time to time. You can revoke access for applications that you don't recognize or that are Tweeting on your behalf by visiting the Applications tab in your account settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== About account security ===\n\nNavigate to your main menuTap Settings and privacyTap AccountTap SecurityToggle on Password reset protection\n\n\n=== About public and protected Tweets ===\n\nYour browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n\n\n=== How to use precise location on mobile devices ===\n\nDelivery of content, including Tweets and advertising, that is better tailored to your location.Delivery of location-specific trends.Showing your followers the location you are Tweeting from as part of your Tweet, if you decide to geotag your Tweet.Â \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How to enable and disable location services at the device level\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 1\n          \n\nGo to your device's Settings feature and tap Privacy.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 2\n          \n\nTap Location Services.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 3\n          \n\nNext to Location Services, drag the slider to turn the feature on.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 4\n          \n\nThen, locate the Twitter app in the list and tap Never or While using the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 1\n          \n\nGo to your device's Settings feature and tap Apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 2\n          \n\nLocate Twitter in the list of your apps and tap Permissions, then toggle the switch next to Location to turn on or off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      How to enable and disable precise location at the account level within the Twitter app\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 1\n          \n\nIn the top menu, tap your profile icon, then tap Settings and privacy.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 2\n          \n\nTap Privacy and Safety.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 3\n          \n\nUnder Safety, tap Precise location in the Location section.\n\n\n\n\n            Step 4\n          \n\nWithin the Precise location page, drag the slider to turn the feature on or off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Step 1\n          \n\nIn the top menu, you will either see a navigation menu iconÂ \n\n\n or your profile icon.

This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it.Â This allows Twitter to collect, store, and use your precise location, such as GPS information.\nOnce you've enabled precise location, you will be able to attach a location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your Tweet. Simply tap the location marker while composing your Tweet, and select the location you wish to tag.\nNote: Once you Tweet with a location, your next Tweet will automatically include a general location label. Learn how to turn location off at any time.Third-party applications or websites may let you Tweet with location, including your precise location. We ask these developers to clearly explain what information is being shared when you use their products to Tweet with location.Â \nÂ \nWhat controls do I have when I attach location information to my Tweets?\n Â \nEven after you enable Tweeting with your location, you have additional control over which Tweets (and what type of location information) is shared. With this in mind:\nTweet location is off by default, and you will need to opt in to the service.\nYou can turn Tweet location on or off at any time.Â You can delete your past location data from displaying in your Tweets in a single place (see this article for step-by-step instructions).Be cautious and careful about the amount of information you share online. There may be some updates where you want to share your location (\"The parade is starting now\" or \"A truck just spilled delicious candy all over the roadway!\"), and some updates where you want to keep your location private. Just like you might not want to Tweet your home address, please be cautious when Tweeting from locations that you don't want others to see.Remember that when you're opted into Tweet location, suggested locations may be offered to you, but you can still choose not to share your location for individual Tweets (see this article for instructions).Please familiarize yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications and devices you Tweet with so that you are always aware of the information you share.Remember, once you post something online, itâs out there for others to see.\nÂ \nWhat location information is displayed?\nÂ \nAll geolocation information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your browser or device. Twitter won't show any location information unless you've opted in to the feature, and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your coordinates to us.If you have chosen to attach location information to your Tweets, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the Tweet.On twitter.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a neighborhood or city.When you use the in-app camera on Twitter for iOS and Android to attach a photo or video to your TweetÂ and toggle on the option to tag your precise location, that Tweet will include both the location label of your choice and your device's precise location (latitude and longitude), which can be found via API. Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you select.Â This is helpful when sharing on-the-ground moments.\nNote:Â The option to share your precise location from the in-app camera is currently available only on newer versions of Twitter for iOS (6.26 or later) and on newer versions of Twitter for Android (version 5.55 or later).Â Application developers are required to be up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place, will be included in your Tweet. When you Tweet from a third-party application or mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be included in your Tweet.\n\n\n\n\nNote: In some areas, you have the option to label your Tweet with a specific business, landmark, or point of interest. These places are sourced from Foursquare. If you see an issue with a place, please report it via Foursquareâs Help Center. If you believe that a specific Tweet is abusive, please report it to Twitter.\n\n\n=== About your email and phone number discoverability privacy settings ===\n\nYour browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n\n\n=== Report impersonation accounts ===\n\nImpersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules.

Don't download any attachments from these emails.Find more account security tips in our Help Center.\nÂ \nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat's phishing?\n\nPhishing scammers send fraudulent messages to a large number of people, in an attempt to trick them into revealing private information, like a password. An email or website may be disguised to appear legitimate.\nIt can be difficult to recognize a spoofed email as they may look very convincing or appear to come from a Twitter email address. You can check the headers of an email to find out more about the source of the message, and you should be suspicious of new or unexpected emails. Twitter doesn't send emails with attachments, and will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.\nÂ \nWhat if I'm worried that someone has access to my Twitter username and password?\n Â \nIf you suspect your account has been compromised, you can find out what to do on our compromised accounts help page.\nIf Twitter believes your account has been hacked, we may reset the account password to prevent the hacker from misusing your account. In this case, we'll email you a secure link to where you can select a new password. Again, this link will always be on the https://twitter.com website, and we never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.\nÂ \nWhy am I getting these fake emails?\n\n\nTwitter doesn't send these emails. The FTC has a help page that describes some ways spammers may find your email address: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/.\nFor more information about Twitter's policies on information collection, as well as disclosure and sharing, please visit our privacy page at https://twitter.com/privacy.\n\n\n=== About offensive content ===\n\nTwitter is a social broadcast network that enables people and organizations to publicly share brief messages instantly around the world. This brings a variety of people with different voices, ideas, and perspectives. People are allowed to post content, including potentially inflammatory content, as long as theyâre not violating the Twitter Rules. Itâs important to know that Twitter does not screen content or remove potentially offensive content.\nAs a policy, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users. However, targeted abuse or harassment may constitute a violation of the Twitter Rules and Terms of Service. If you are a victim of targeted abuse or harassment, read more about online abuse.Â \nHave you seen something on Twitter you disagree with? Here are some tips that may help you deal with your situation:\nÂ \nConsider the context\n Â \nTwitter lets us participate in broad conversations and connect with people from many corners of the world. While hearing from more people can be enriching, it can also be a source of frustration and misunderstanding if the context of the conversation is not considered. Seeing your username mentioned in a Tweet can be confusing if you donât understand why it was used.Â \nWhen you see an upsetting Tweet, step back and consider the larger conversation it may be connected to. Since individual Tweets are short, the authorâs intended meaning may have been lost or distorted. Tweet back with a replyÂ to join the conversation and surface the concern. Send a Direct Message if you would prefer to communicate privately. Having more information makes it easier to understand the context and can lead to healthy dialogue.\nÂ \nThink before you Tweet\n Â \nHealthy conversation is a shared responsibility.Â If your Tweet reply is identified as using potentially harmful or offensive language, we may ask you, via a prompt, if you want to review it before sending. There will be options to send, edit, or delete the Tweet reply. And if you think we make a mistake, you can let us know.\nNote: These prompts are only available to people using Twitter in English.\nÂ \nBlock and ignore\n Â \nUnderstanding the context often diffuses a negative or confusing interaction, but, there are times when further action, like unfollowing or blocking someone, may be more effective. When you block, you will not be notified when they mention you, Retweet you, like your content, add you to a list or follow one of your lists. You also wonât see any of these interactions in your timeline.Â \nFor more information on how to manage a situation that you believe is abusive, read this article about online abuse.Â \nThere are also many online safety resourcesÂ that can help.\nÂ \nÂ\n\n\n=== About age screening on Twitter ===\n\nWhat is age screening?\nÂ \nAge screening is a way for brands and others to determine online whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, in a way that is consistent with relevant industry or legal guidelines. This makes it easier for advertisers and others with content not suitable for minors (e.g. alcohol advertisers) to advertise on Twitter.\nÂ \nHow does age screening work on Twitter?\nÂ \nTwitter has developed a solution for brands that requires new Twitter followers to enter their birth date before being permitted to follow their account. If you have already entered your date of birth on your profile page, it will be detected and you will be able to immediately follow the account. If you have not already entered your date of birth on your profile page, we will ask you to enter your date of birth on your profile page settings.Â \nThe feature was designed to help brands determine whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, while at the same time providing an easy and secure way for you to follow accounts that you would otherwise be blocked from following. Twitter advertisers who use the solution will not have access to your birthdate or age unless your birthday visibility settings permit them to view this information on your profile, but will know when youâve entered an age thatâs above their indicated threshold. This feature is free, and available to a select number of our advertising partners.\nÂ \nDoes age screening comply with applicable guidelines and best practices?\nÂ \nCompliance with specific industry guidelines around age screening and age-based targeting is the responsibility of the brand.\n\n\n=== What to do about self-harm and suicide concerns on Twitter ===\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, youâre not alone. Use the contact info below to get help.\nUnited States: Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Crisis workers are available 24 hours a day. Calls are free and confidential.Other countries & regions: To find a crisis center near you, visit International Association for Suicide Prevention.\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior, you should seek help as soon as possible by contacting services with expertise in crisis intervention and suicide prevention. You can also alert the Twitter team focused on handling reports associated with accounts that may be engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior if you encounter this type of content on Twitter.\nÂ \nTwitterâs approach to content associated self-harm and suicide threats\n Â \nAfter receiving a report of someone who may be thinking about self-harm or suicide, Twitter will contact the affected individual to let them know that someone who cares about them identified that they might be at risk of harm. We will also encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources that can help.\nÂ \nRecognize the signs\n Â \nJudging behavior based on online posts alone is challenging, but there are potential warning signs or indicators that someone may be thinking aboutÂ  self-harm or suicide. Below are questions that you may ask yourself to help assess if an individual may be experiencing suicidal thoughts:\nDoes this person frequently post content about depression or feelings of hopelessness?\nIs this person posting comments about death or feelings that death is the only option?\nAre they posting comments about having attempted suicide in the past?\nAre they describing or posting photos of self-harm or identifying themselves as suicidal?\nHas their mood and the content of their posts changed recently?\nÂ \n\nIf you are concerned and know the person involved, it can be helpful to contact them personallyÂ  and encourage them to seek advice from dedicated services who may be able to help. If, on the other hand, you donât know the person involved, you may still choose to contact them to express concern or refer them to dedicated organizations , a suicide hotline, or someone who might know them personally. If you donât feel comfortable reaching out to the person on your own or arenât sure how to reach them, you can also alert Twitter via our dedicated reporting flow.\nÂ \nManaging experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts\n Â \nIf you are thinking about engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior, or are experiencing feelings of depression or anxiety, it may help to talk to people that you trust or to connect with dedicated organizations who can provide support and assistance to help manage these experiences.\nDepression has a wide variety of symptoms and affects millions of people every year. Common symptoms include sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, loss of energy, difficulty thinking, and possibly thoughts of suicide. You might exhibit these types of behaviors, or they might be subtler. Either way, donât ignore them.\nÂ\n\n\n=== About online abuse ===\n\nBeing the target of online abuse and bullying is not easy to deal with. Knowing the appropriate steps to take to address your situation can help you through the process.\nÂ \nWhen to report it?\nÂ \nWeâve all seen something on the Internet we disagree with or have received unwanted communication. Such behavior does not necessarily constitute online abuse and cyberbullying. If you see or receive a reply you donât like, unfollow and end any communication with that account.Â \nIf the behavior continues, it is recommended that you block the account. Blocking will prevent that person from following you, seeing your profile image on their profile page, or in their timeline; additionally, their replies or mentions will not show in your Notifications tab (although these Tweets may still appear in search).\nAbusive accounts often lose interest once they realize that you will not respond. If the account in question is a friend, try addressing the issue offline. If you have had a misunderstanding, it may be possible to clear the matter up face to face or with the help of a trusted individual.\nIf you continue receiving unwanted, targeted and continuous replies on Twitter, and feel it constitutes online abuse, consider reporting the behavior to Twitter.\nÂ \nTake threats seriouslyÂ \nÂ \nIf you believe you are in physical danger, contact the local law enforcement authorities who have the tools to address the issue.\nIf you decide to work with law enforcement, make sure to do the following:\nDocument the violent or abusive messages with print-outs or screenshots\nBe as specific as possible about why you are concernedProvide any context you have around who you believe might be involved, such as evidence of abusive behavior found on other websitesProvide any information regarding previous threats you may have receivedÂ \nYou can report the content to Twitter here.Â \nÂ \nReach out to the people you trust\nÂ \nWhen dealing with negative or hurtful interactions, it can help to turn to family and friends for support and advice. Oftentimes, talking with your relatives or a close friend may help you figure out how you want to handle the situation or let you express your feelings so you can move on.\nÂ \nHelp others\nÂ \nTrying to figure out how to help someone in such a situation can be daunting. This Twitter Support article offers some suggestions for how to help a friend or family member with online abuse.Â Â \nIf you see a violent or abusive message directed at someone else, communicate your concern to the recipient and encourage them to contact Twitter and their local authorities.Â \nThere are also many online safety resources that can help.\n\n\n=== What's new ===\n\n\n\n\n=== What's new ===\n\n\n\n\n=== What's new ===\n\n\n\n\n=== What's new ===\n\nWhat's new\n\n\n=== What's new ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Glorification of violence policy ===\n\nOverview\n Â \nMarch 2019\nYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.\nGlorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent events where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) could incite or lead to further violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy against content that glorifies acts of violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and cause real offline harm, or events where members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims.\n\n\nWhat is in violation of this policy?Â \n Â \nUnder this policy, you canât glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as âIâm glad this happenedâ, âThis person is my heroâ, âI wish more people did things like thisâ, or âI hope this inspires others to actâ.Â \nViolations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating:\nviolent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass shootings;attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent extremism policy); andviolent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide.Â \nÂ \nWhat is not a violation of this policy?\n Â \nOur focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as violent events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent acts by state actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups.Â \nÂ \nWho can report violations of this policy?\n Â \nAnyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.Â \nÂ \nHow can I report violations of this policy?\n Â \nIn-app\n Â \nYou can report this content for review in-app as follows:\nSelect Report Tweet from theÂ \n\n\n icon.Â Select Itâs abusive or harmful.Select Threatening violence or physical harm.Select the relevant option depending on who you are reporting on behalf of.Select up to 5 Tweets to report for review.Submit your report.\nÂ \nDesktop\n Â \nYou can report this content for review via desktop as follows:\nSelect Report Tweet from theÂ \n\n\n icon.Â Select Itâs abusive or harmful.Select Threatening violence or physical harm.Select the relevant option depending on who you are reporting on behalf of.Select up to 5 Tweets to report for review.Submit your report.\nÂ \nReport form\nÂ \nYou can also report this content for review via our abusive behavior reporting form, by selecting the Harassment option.\nÂ \nWhat happens if you violate this policy?\n Â \nThe consequences for violating our glorification of violence policy depends on the severity of the violation and the accountâs previous history of violations.\nThe first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.\n\n\nAdditional resources\n Â \nLearn more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement.\nTo learn about the link between glorifying violent acts and offline harm, you can refer to the research of Susan Benesch: Countering Dangerous Speech: New Ideas for Genocide Prevention and the Dangerous Speech Project.\n\n\n=== Copyright policy ===\n\nWhat types of copyright complaints does Twitter respond to?\n\nTwitter responds to copyrightÂ complaints submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (âDMCAâ). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice.\nTwitter will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting services, or Tweets containing links to allegedly infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements (see ourÂ fair useÂ article for more information).\nIf you are concerned about the use of your brand or entityâs name, please reviewÂ Twitterâs trademark policy. If you are concerned about a parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan account, please see the relevant policyÂ here. These are generally not copyright issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I a copyright holder? How do I know?\n\nIf you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another adviser as Twitter cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about copyright law includingÂ http://copyright.gov,Â https://lumendatabase.org/, andÂ http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to consider before submitting a copyright complaint\n\nBefore submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider whether or not the use could be consideredÂ fair use.Â \nIf you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user. You can reply to the userâs Tweet or send the user a Direct Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without having to contact Twitter.Â \nPrior to submitting a formal complaint with Twitter, please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneysâ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.\nNote: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph. If youâre unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or if youâre infringing upon someone elseâs work, please consult an attorney or another advisor.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information do you need to process a copyright complaint?\n\nTo submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information:\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit Twitter to locate the material on our website or services;Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; andA statement that the information in the complaint is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\nÂ \nIf you are reporting the content of a Tweet, please give us a direct link to that Tweet. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR TWITTER TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I file a copyright complaint?\n\nYou can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting Twitterâs Help Center andÂ filing a copyright complaint.Â If you are logged in to twitter.com, you can visit the Twitter Help Center directly from your Twitter account by clicking the âHelpâ link located in the sidebar.\nFiling a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material in question.\nIf you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report for you.\nPlease be aware that under 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneysâ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a copyright complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are claims processed?\n\nWe process copyright complaints in the order in which they are received. Once you've submitted your ticket, we will email you a ticket confirmation. If you do not receive a ticket confirmation that means we did not receive your complaint and you should re-submit your complaint. However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright complaints will result in a delay in processing.\nIf we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) and provide them with a full copy of the reporterâs complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice. We will also forward a redacted copy of the complaint toÂ Lumen, with your personal information removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)? \n\nIf we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive a copy of the complaint, including the reporterâs full name, email, street address, and any other information included in the complaint.Â \nIf you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the reported user(s), you may wish to consider appointing an agent to submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required to submit the DMCA notice with valid contact information, and identify you as the content owner that they are representing.Â \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTwitterâs response to copyright complaints may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright complaint, Twitter will make a good faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a full copy of the complaint, along with instructions for filing a counter-notice.\nIf youâve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint regarding the content removed from your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you.\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted content, we clearly mark withheld Tweets and media to indicate to viewers when content has been withheld (examples below). We also send a redacted copy of each copyright complaint and counter-notice that we process to Lumen, where they are posted to a public-facing website (with your personal information removed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          My content was removed from Twitter\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did I receive a copyright complaint?\n\nIf you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the content described in the complaint has been restricted. Please take the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes information on the complaint we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are monitoring the email address associated with your Twitter account.\nTip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will not resolve that complaint\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I want to contest the takedown?\n\nIf you believe that the materials reported in the copyrightÂ complaints\nwere misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a counter-notification(s)Â through our Help Center. A counter-notice is a request for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences. Alternatively, you may be able to seek a retraction of the copyright complaint from the reporter.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I seek a retraction?\n\nThe DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of the reporter. You may want to reach out and ask them to retract their notice using ourÂ retraction form. This is the fastest and most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright complaint. Alternatively, the reporter can also send a retraction notice toÂ copyright@twitter.com.Â  Such notice should include: (1) identification of the material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter would like to retract their DMCA notice.Â  A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter, and only that reporter can issue a retraction.Â  If a portion of your tweet has been withheld, the violation will not be resolved just by deleting the remaining portion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I file a counter-notice?\n\nA counter-notice is a request for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and is the start of a legal process that has legal consequences.Â  For example, submitting a counter notice indicates that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal court and that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to the reporter and Lumen website.\nWith these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if you believe that this material was misidentified, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed.Â  If youâre unsure whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you may want to consult with an attorney.\nTip:Â Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright complaint may result in permanent account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice rather than re-posting the material.Â \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information do you need to process a counter-notice?\n\nTo submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information:\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);Your full name, address (including country), telephone number, and for verification purposes, your Twitter username and associated email;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before that removal or disabling (the description from the copyright notice will suffice);A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; andOne of the following jurisdictional consent statements:\n(If your address is in the United States)Â \nâI consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located and Iâll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.â\nOR\n(If your address is outside of the United States)Â \n\"I consent to any judicial district in which Twitter may be found, and Iâll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.\"\n\nTo submit a counter-notice, please provide all of the above information using our web form, locatedÂ here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after I submit a counter-notice?\n\nUpon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice. This means that the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice will be shared to the person who filed the original notice.Â \nIf the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against you.Â  If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.\nWe cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiling a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!\n\nPlease think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holderâs behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if my account receives one or more copyright complaints?\n\nIf multiple copyright complaints are received about an account, or other evidence suggests a pattern of repeat infringement, Twitter may suspend that account in accordance with our Repeat Infringer Policy.Â Our Repeat Infringer Policy takes valid retractions and counter-notices into account. Users suspended under that policy may file a suspension appeal usingÂ this form.\nAdditionally, re-posting material that was already removed in response to a copyright complaint, indicating where to access copyrighted material on third party websites, or certain other actions that demonstrate your account is intended solely or primarily to infringe the copyrighted material of others may result in permanent account suspension. If you are suspended on this basis, you may file an appeal usingÂ this form. Please be aware that appealing a suspension does not guarantee your account will be reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n=== About Twitter limits ===\n\nWhy have limits?\n Â \nLimits alleviate some of the strain on the behind-the-scenes part of Twitter and reduce downtime and error pages. For the sake of reliability, we've placed some limits on the account actions below.\nÂ \nCurrent Twitter limits\n Â \nThe current technical limits for accounts are:\nDirect Messages (daily): The limit is 500 messages sent per day.Tweets: 2,400 per day. The daily update limit is further broken down into smaller limits for semi-hourly intervals. Retweets are counted as Tweets.Changes to account email: 4 per hour.Following (daily): The technical follow limit is 400 per day. Please note that this is a technical account limit only, and there are additional rules prohibiting aggressive following behavior.Â Following (account-based): Once an account is following 5,000 other accounts, additional follow attempts are limited by account-specific ratios.Â \nThese limits include actions from all devices, including web, mobile, phone, API, etc. API requests from all third-party applications are tracked against the hourly API limit. People who use multiple third-party applications with their account will therefore reach the API limit more quickly.Â \nThese limits may be temporarily reduced during periods of heavy site usage. In such cases, we will post an update on the Twitter status site.\nÂ \nWhat happens if I hit a limit?\n Â \nIf you do reach a limit, we'll let you know with an error message telling you which limit you've hit. For limits that are time-based (like the Direct Messages, Tweets, changes to account email, and API request limits), you'll be able to try again after the time limit has elapsed.\nThe Tweet limit of 2,400 updates per day is further broken down into semi-hourly intervals. If you hit your account update/Tweet limit, please try again in a few hours after the limit period has elapsed.\nÂ \nHaving trouble?\n Â \nIf you've hit a follow limit, please see this follow limit troubleshooting article for more information.\n\n\n=== How cookies are used on Twitter ===\n\nCookies and similar technologies like pixels and local storage provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience on Twitter.
