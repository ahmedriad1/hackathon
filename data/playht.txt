=== How to change audio player message using a shortcode ===
Your audio players can be customized to match the look and feel of your website. Apart from the color of the players, you can also change the what text is displayed on the players. 

Normally, you'd save these settings from the Audio Player Customizations Page once and the settings will reflect on all your players. But sometimes, you might want to display a different message on the audio player for just specific articles. You can do that using a Short-code!

1. Copy and paste the Audio Player Short-code

![Audio player shortcode](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/904f694116fab000/screen-shot-2021-03-13-at-5032_1p3qlim.png)

After adding audio to a post, you'll find it's short-code in the post's edit page. 

Just copy and paste the short-code in the article's text as shown below.

|| The audio player will be displayed at the position where the short-code is pasted.

If you are using the Block Editor, you can use the Short-code block as shown below, otherwise you can simply paste the short-code in the article's text.

![shortcode block](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/904f694116fab000/screen-shot-2021-03-13-at-5074_92el4.png)


![paste short code](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/904f694116fab000/screen-shot-2021-03-13-at-5181_gh3xia.png)

2. Edit the Short-Code 
Once you have pasted the short-code, you can now add some extra data to it to change the default message.


![shortcode data](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/904f694116fab000/screen-shot-2021-03-13-at-5124_pansc0.png)

You can add the following data in the short-code to change the messages on the audio player - 

``title: Use this to change the primary message on the audio player. By default, the message is - Listen to this content.``

``message: Use this to change the marketing message of audio player. By default it is Powered by Play.ht``

|| Remember to save the post after editing the Short-Code because only then the changes will reflect.

# How to use the code snippet to automatically add audio to your Squarespace blog posts

The code snippet allows you to automatically embed audio players in your blog posts when you convert them to audio. 

The way it works is, it looks at the URL of the blog post to determine whether or not to display the audio players or no. Before you paste the code snippet, you can select and customize what players you need and how they should look like. Once you've pasted the snippet, all you need to do then is simply convert your blog posts to audio from the Play.ht dashboard (https://play.ht/app/)

![](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/904f694116fab000/screen-shot-2020-05-02-at-4101_grr1el.png)

6. Save the setting.

At times you might want position the audio player in a different place as by default it gets added at the beginning of the Medium story. Here's how you can place it in a different location:

1. We want the Medium story to be converted to audio first. So if you haven't converted it already, go ahead and do it now.

2. Once the story is converted to audio, you can access the audio file from your Web Dashboard here - https://play.ht/app/audio-files/

3. Select the Medium Story you just converted and click on the Embed button to see options of embedding it into different platforms.
