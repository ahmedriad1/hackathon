OAuth is a secure connection method and doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t require you to give your Twitter username and password to the third party. You should be particularly cautious when you\'re asked to give your username and password to an app or website. When you give your username and password to someone else, they can gain complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a login page for a third-party app is using OAuth, go directly to twitter.com and enter your credentials there, and then navigate back to the app. If the app is using OAuth, the app should not require you to enter your username and password again. You can learn more about how to check that you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re on twitter.com with our account security tips.\n\nIf you previously provided your password to an app that you are now unsure about, revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You should be especially wary of and never provide your username and password to:\nWebsites claiming to help you \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cget more followers fast!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (see our following rules and best practices for more information).Apps which post affiliate ads to your timeline.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nIf you suspect a bad app is still connected to your account\n\r\nImmediately revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.

Before you enter your username and password, check that the page is secure by verifying the URL starts with https://twitter.com.

OAuth is a secure connection method and doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t require you to give your Twitter username and password to the third party. You should be particularly cautious when you\'re asked to give your username and password to an app or website. When you give your username and password to someone else, they can gain complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a login page for a third-party app is using OAuth, go directly to twitter.com and enter your credentials there, and then navigate back to the app. If the app is using OAuth, the app should not require you to enter your username and password again. You can learn more about how to check that you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re on twitter.com with our account security tips.\n\nIf you previously provided your password to an app that you are now unsure about, revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You should be especially wary of and never provide your username and password to:\nWebsites claiming to help you \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cget more followers fast!\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d (see our following rules and best practices for more information).Apps which post affiliate ads to your timeline.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nIf you suspect a bad app is still connected to your account\n\r\nImmediately revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password. If you are experiencing problems with an app, please read the compromised accounts article for more information.\n\n\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re having issues with a third-party app\n\r\nBecause third-party apps are not owned and operated by Twitter, we\'re not able to troubleshoot them. It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s best to reach out to the app developer for answers to your questions or to let them know about a problem you\'re having with their product.'

b'What does the blue checkmark mean?\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe definition of verification and the accompanying blue checkmark is changing. Until now, Twitter used the blue checkmark to indicate active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest that Twitter had independently verified based on\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0certain requirements.\n\n\n\n\nNow the blue checkmark may mean two different things: either that an account was verified under the previous verification criteria (active, notable, and authentic), or that the account has an active subscription to Twitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s new Twitter Blue subscription service, which was made available on iOS in the US, Canada, Australia New Zealand and the UK on November 9, 2022. Accounts that receive the blue checkmark as part of a Twitter Blue subscription will not undergo review to confirm that they meet the active, notable and authentic criteria that was used in the previous process.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note, to minimize impersonation risks, display name changes will be temporarily restricted on Verified accounts. This will impact accounts Verified under the legacy program and Twitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s new Twitter Blue subscription product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Eligibility criteria\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly accounts subscribed to Twitter Blue on iOS on or after November 9, 2022 are eligible for the blue checkmark moving forward.\nAs a result of this change, at this time, Twitter will no longer be accepting new applications for Verification under the previous criteria.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nNote that all accounts subscribed to Twitter Blue on iOS on or after November 9, 2022 will automatically receive a blue checkmark, which will persist for the duration of the subscribers\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 subscription term.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Loss of the blue checkmark for Twitter Blue subscribers\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Blue subscribers\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 blue checkmarks may be taken away at any time for any reason at all by Twitter, including as the result of certain types of violations of the Twitter Rules, including but not limited to our rules around spam, ban evasion, and impersonation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Loss of the blue checkmark for legacy verified accounts\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy verified accounts also may be taken away at any time for any reason at all by Twitter, including as the result of certain\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 types of violations of the Twitter Rules, including but not limited to our rules around spam, ban evasion, and Impersonation. In addition, legacy verified accounts are still subject to the guidelines outlined in the \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cLoss of Verified Status\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d section of the previous policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          What does the \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Official\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 profile label mean?\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to blue checkmarks, Twitter also applies visual identity signals like labels and badges on account profiles to provide more context about \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 and help distinguish \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 different types of accounts.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThe Official profile label is applied to government accounts (institutional accounts, elected or appointed officials, and multilateral organizations)*, certain political organizations such as political parties, commercial companies including business partners, major brands, media outlets and publishers, and some other public figures.\n\n*State-affiliated media and government accounts that play a role as a geopolitical or official Government communication channel display a unique label.

b'Writing image descriptions on Twitter is different from writing them elsewhere on the Web in three ways:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTwitter has a character limit of 1,000.The description is the only place that guarantees a description of an image.Everyone can access it.\nThe goal of writing image descriptions is to be clear and concise, while giving more context to your Tweet.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Like Tweets, image descriptions must follow the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter Rules.\nHere\'s a list of recommendations for writing great image descriptions with examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Image description recommendations\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          The List\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture what\'s importantBe succinct, clear, and detailedBe objectiveWrite out or summarize text in imagesWatch out for acronyms and abbreviationsInclude the image type detailsUse regular sentence structure and letter casingAvoid redundant informationTake care with complex visuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Details and examples\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n1. Capture what\'s important\nIt\'s important to capture action, movement, relationships, noteworthiness, visual details, and anything unique.\nNote people, pets, things, their names (if relevant), and their relationship to each other. Depending on topic relevance, mention the race, gender, age, etc. of people.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture what\'s important example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            1. \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nMy puppy, Beatrix, sits on the left. On the right is the bag of charcoal she just finished shredding. Hunks of charcoal and pieces of the bag are scattered on the floor, along with her red octopus toy.\nThis description is 201 characters long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n2. Be succinct, clear, and detailed\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThe character limit for image descriptions is 1,000. Previously, some assistive technology (such as screen readers) stopped reading at 200-250 characters. While this is no longer the case, it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s still important to be succinct in your description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe succinct, clear, and detailed example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            2.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 224 characters, a long version of this image description could be:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nA small white mug with a tiny loop handle, with a shot of deep brown espresso and a light brown crema on top. The mug sits on a small white saucer on a medium brown wooden table with clear grain running mostly top to bottom.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nA shorter version, at 137 characters, could be:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nA shot of espresso with a light brown crema inside a white espresso mug with loop handle. The mug sits on a white saucer on a wood table.\nThe shorter version does it in 87 characters less.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n3.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Be objective\nUnless it\'s an image of yourself, or you know exactly what\'s happening in the image, don\'t editorialize, or make assumptions about what\'s happening. Simply provide enough objective context so readers understand the relevance of the image to your Tweet.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nFor example, if the image is of a politician you don\'t like, don\'t refer to their \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9csilly little face.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Say instead that they\'re \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9csmiling, close-lipped into the camera.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe objective example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            3.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nThree smiling men sit on a wicker couch, with no cushions, at the top of a hill covered in packed snow. They\'re wearing winter coats, gloves, wet jeans, and snow-encrusted shoes. A factory looms in the background, and a group of people with sleds are gathered at the bottom of the hill.\nThis description is 298 characters. Instead of saying the men look like they\'re having fun, which is subjective, you can say they\'re smiling. Happiness is implied. Also, it looks like the men in this image are about to couch sled down the hill. They aren\'t actively doing so though. To say that they are is to create a story out of the image, instead of just describing the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n4.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Write out or summarize text in images\nIf there\'s text in the image, include it in your description. If it\'s more than 1,000 characters of text, do your best to summarize it, focusing on its relevance to your Tweet.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf it\'s a legal document, for example, summarize the content and provide a link to the source in your Tweet, not the image description.\nDepending on what you write in your Tweet, you can exclude certain details from the image description. This also avoids redundancy for readers. For example, if you mention the name of the author and the title of a book in your Tweet, you don\'t need to repeat that information in the image description.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText in images example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            4.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nA hand holds open a book of poetry by Mary Oliver called \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDog Songs.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d The name of the poem displayed is \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe Poetry Teacher.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d On the opposite page is an illustration of a Beagle laying in the grass. The poem is about how the author negotiated with a university to allow her dog to go with her while she teaches a poetry class.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThis description is 326 characters. Notice that context was given to the description that does not appear in the image.

Watch out for acronyms and abbreviations\nAcronyms should be capitalized. If they\'re not, some screen readers may read them as words, which might not make sense in context. Non-capitalized acronyms may also increase reading difficulty for sighted readers.\nTry to spell out words instead of using abbreviations. Screen readers don\'t always announce them in a meaningful way.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nFor example, with abbreviations like "Dr." for "doctor," some screen readers read each letter instead of reading them as words. So "Dr. Calvin" is read as "d r Calvin." Some people will catch that, or be able to process what it actually means, but others won\'t. The exception is if you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re writing out abbreviated text that appears in an image.\nEveryone who reads your description may not know what certain abbreviations mean. Readers who don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t speak or read the same language may struggle to understand the meaning.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcronyms and abbreviations example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            5.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nBlack and white photo of two young women walking past Doctor Calvin\'s office, down the brick sidewalk along Lexington Avenue in early December. They\'re bundled up in winter coats.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThis description is 179 characters. Words that could have been abbreviated are "black and white," "Doctor," "Avenue," and "December." The spelled-out words don\'t detract from the description, nor do they significantly impact the character count.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n6. Include the image type details\nMention if something is a close-up, aerial shot, or black and white photo.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s artwork, describe the type of art: painting, portrait, sculpture, illustration, etc. If there\'s a specific genre associated, add that as well. For example, "anime illustration" instead of just "illustration."\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage type details example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            6.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nA view from a hilltop looking down into a valley. Rows of corn stretch from side to side of the photo. The setting sunlight makes the fields look auburn instead of yellow. Beyond the crop rows are softly rising hills, with a few buildings and trees on them. Beyond that are even steeper hills, some shrouded in shadow by long, flat stratus clouds.\nThis description is 347 characters. It\'s a bit long, but hopefully it captures the image contents in an evocative way.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n7. Use regular sentence structure and letter casing\nDescribe the image in complete sentences instead of listing its characteristics. Write in a way that sounds natural or conversational.\nWrite in sentence case instead of all lowercase or ALL CAPS (unless it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s an acronym or abbreviation).\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentence structure example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            7.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this image, the description could be:\nA view of a slice of the city Sintra, Portugal on an overcast, chilly day.

On top of the hill in the distance is Castelo dos Mouros (Castle of the Moors).\nThis description is 276 characters.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n8.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Avoid redundant information\nDon\'t write "Photo of" or "Image of." Assistive technology will know it\'s an image and communicate that to users. Do mention if something is a screenshot. It can be useful for readers to have that extra context.\nDon\'t repeat information that you write in your Tweet in the image description. For example, if you share a photo of a book cover, and mention the author\'s name and book title in your Tweet, don\'t repeat that information in the description; instead describe the book cover. If you don\'t mention that information in your Tweet, then do include it in your description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid redundant information example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            8.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this image could be:\nScreenshot of a Tweet from @Twitter on October 4th that says, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chello literally everyone.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d There were 118,400 comments, 784,200 retweets, and 3.3 million likes.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThis description is 159 characters.

These visuals often need lengthy image descriptions. The goal for these descriptions is to describe trends and findings, not explain the research behind it. Instead, add a link to the source in your Tweet so readers can get more information if they want it.\nFor maps, describe the overall information shown.

b'The ALT badge\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"ALT" is the abbreviation for alternative text, which is the technical name for image description.

Please review each service\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s terms for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I choose a payment provider for tipping?\n\nWhen you set up, or add additional third-party service(s) to, through your Tips settings, you may only choose from the select third-party service(s) listed in your Tips settings.

Can anyone listen in a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces can be listened to by anyone on the Internet. This is part of a broader feature of Spaces that lets anyone listen to Spaces regardless of whether or not they are logged in to a Twitter account (or even have a Twitter account). Because of this, listener counts may not match the actual number of listeners, nor will the profile photos of all listeners necessarily be displayed in a Space.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I invite people to join a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvite people to join a Space by sending an invite via DM, Tweeting the link out to your Home timeline, or copying the invite link to send it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can join my Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, all Spaces are public and anyone can join any Space as a listener. If the listener has a user account, you can block their account. If you create a Space or are a speaker in a Space, your followers will see it at the top of their timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can speak in my Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, your Space will always be set to\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Only people you invite to speak. You can also modify the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Speaker permissions\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0once your Space has been created. Select the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon, then select\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Adjust settings\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to see the options for speaker permissions, which include\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Everyone,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0People you follow, and the default\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Only people you invite to speak. These permissions are only saved for this particular Space, so any Space you create in the future will use the default setting.\nOnce your Space has started, you can send requests to listeners to become speakers\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0or co-hosts by selecting the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon and adding speakers or selecting a person\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s profile picture within a Space and adding them as a co-host or speaker. Listeners can request to speak from the host.\nHosts can also invite other people outside of the Space to speak via DM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does co-hosting work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 2 people can become co-hosts and speak in a Space in addition to the 11 speakers (including the primary host) at one time. Co-host status can be lost if the co-host leaves the Space. A co-host can remove their own co-host status to become a Listener again.\nHosts can transfer primary admin rights to another co-host. If the original host drops from Space, the first co-host added will become the primary admin.\nOnce a co-host is added to a Space, any accounts they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve blocked on Twitter who are in the Space will be removed from the Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I schedule a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts can schedule a Space up to 30 days in advance and up to 10 scheduled Spaces. Hosts can still create impromptu Spaces in the meantime, and those won\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t count toward the maximum 10 scheduled Spaces.\nBefore you create your Space, select the scheduler\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0icon and pick the date and time you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d like to schedule your Space to go live.

When creating a Space, toggle on Record Space.\nWhile recording, a recording symbol will appear at the top to indicate that the Space is being recorded by the host. Once the Space ends, you will see how many people attended the Space along with a link to share out via a Tweet. Under Notifications, you can also View details to Tweet the recording. Under host settings, you will have the option to choose where to start your recording with Edit start time. This allows you to cut out any dead air time that might occur at the beginning of a Space.\nIf you choose to record your Space, once the live Space ends, your recording will be immediately and publicly available for anyone to listen to whenever they want. You can always end a recording to make it no longer publicly available on Twitter by deleting your recording via the more \n\n\n icon on the recording itself. Unless you delete your recording, it will remain available for replay after the live Space has ended.* As with live Spaces, Twitter will retain audio copies for 30 after they end to review for violations of the Twitter Rules. If a violation is found, Twitter may retain audio copies for up to 120 days in total. For more information on downloading Spaces, please see below FAQ, "What happens after a Space ends and is the data retained anywhere?"\nCo-hosts and speakers who enter a Space that is being recorded will see a recording symbol (REC). Listeners will also see the recording symbol, but they will not be visible in the recording.\nRecordings will show the host, co-host(s), and speakers from the live Space.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n*Note: Hosts on iOS 9.15+ and Android 9.46+ will be able to record Spaces that last indefinitely. For hosts on older app versions, recording will only be available for 30 days.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0For Spaces that are recorded indefinitely, Twitter will retain a copy for as long as the Space is replayable on Twitter, but for no less than 30 days after the live Space ended.\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is clipping?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClipping is a new feature we\'re currently testing and gradually rolling out that lets a limited group of hosts, speakers, and listeners capture 30 seconds of audio from any live or recorded Space and share it through a Tweet if the host has not disabled the clipping function. To start clipping a Space, follow the instructions below to capture the prior 30 seconds of audio from that Space. There is no limit to the number of clips that participants in a Space can create.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen you enter the Space as a co-host or speaker, you will be informed that the Space is clippable through a tool tip notification above the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0clipping\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon.\n\nNote:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Currently, creating a clip is available only on iOS and Android, while playing a clip is available on all platforms to everyone.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Host instructions: How to turn off clipping\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen you start your Space, you\'ll receive a notification about what a clip is and how to turn it off, as clipping is on by default.

Select\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Mute their mic\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and you will receive an in-app notification that will let you know the individual has been muted.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0You also have the option to mute all speakers in your Space at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I see people in my Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts, speakers, and listeners can select the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon to see people in a Space.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Since Spaces are publicly accessible by anyone, it may also be possible for an unknown number of logged-out people to listen to a Space\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s audio without being listed as a guest in the Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I report a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think a Space violates the Twitter Rules, you can report it while in the Space by selecting the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0more\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon and selecting\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Report this Space. Anyone in the Space can report it. Speakers and listeners can report a Space and any account in a Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I report a person in a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo report an account in a Space, select the account\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s profile photo and then select\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Report. You will then need to choose the reason for reporting the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many people can speak in a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, a maximum of 13 people (including the host and up to 2 co-hosts) can speak at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many people can listen in a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no limit on the number of listeners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after a Space ends and is the data retained anywhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces are accessible while they are live; once ended, they will no longer be available publicly on Twitter. Twitter retains copies of audio from Spaces and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0available captions for 30 days after a Space ends to review for violations of the Twitter Rules. If a Space is found to contain a violation, we extend the time we maintain a copy for\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0an additional 90 days (a total of 120 days after a Space ends) to allow people to appeal if they believe there was a mistake.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter also uses Spaces content and data for analytics and research to improve the service.\nHosts may download copies of their Spaces for as long as we have them by using the Your Twitter Data download tool.\nLinks to Spaces that are shared out (e.g., via Tweet or DM) also contain some information about the Space, including the description, the identity of the hosts and others in the Space, as well as the Space\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s current state (e.g., scheduled, live, or ended). We make this and other information about Spaces available through the Twitter Developer Platform. For a detailed list of the information about Spaces we make available, check out our Spaces endpoints documentation.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can end a Space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe host of a Space has the ability to end a Space. A Space may also end if it is found to be in violation of the Twitter Rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Spaces work for accounts with protected Tweets?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Spaces accessible for people who are deaf or hard of hearing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in a Space can select the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Show captions\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0button to see automated live captions (with a few seconds of delay).\nCaptions only appear on-screen when a person is looking at a live Space. We do not show captions to a person if they have docked the Space to the bottom of their Twitter app or are off the app (although the audio will continue to play).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Twitter thinking about accessibility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re collaborating internally with our accessibility teams and with an external accessibility vendor for review.\nSpaces will also release with accessibility for screen readers, though like any product, we\'ll continue to make additional improvements over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Spaces support captions or other accessibility options?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in a Space can navigate to the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0more\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon and select the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Show captions\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0button to see automated live captions (with a few seconds of delay).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Spaces Feedback Community\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re opening up the conversation and turning it over to the people who are participating in Spaces.

When I join a Twitter Space, that means I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll be a listener. I can join any Space on Twitter, even those hosted by people I don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t know or follow.\n\n\n\n\n2. I can join a Space by selecting a profile photo with a purple, pulsing outline at the top of my timeline, selecting a link from someone\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Tweet, or a link in a Direct Message (DM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Once I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m in a Space, I can see the profile photos and names of some people in the Space, including myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. I can hear one or multiple people talking at the same time. If it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s too loud or overwhelming, I can turn down my volume.\n\n\n\n\n5. As a listener, I am not able to speak. If I want to say something, I can send a request to the host. The host might not approve my request though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If the host accepts my request, I will become a speaker. It may take a few seconds to connect my microphone, so I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll have to wait.\n\n\n\n\n7.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Now I can unmute myself and speak. Everyone in the Space will be able to hear me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0When someone says something I want to react to, I can choose an emoji to show everyone how I feel. I will be able to see when other people react as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I can leave the Space at any time. After I leave, or when the host ends the Space, I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll go back to my timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0a Space\n\n\n\n\n1.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0When I start a Space, that means I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll be the host. Anyone can join my Space, even people I don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t know and people I don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t follow.\n\n\n\n\n2.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Once I start my space, it may take a few seconds to be connected, so I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll have to wait.\n\n\n\n\n3.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Now I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m in my Space and I can see my profile photo. If other logged-in, people have joined, I will be able to see their profile photos, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I will start out muted, which is what the microphone with a slash through it means. I can mute and unmute myself, and anyone in my Space, at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I can invite people to join my Space by sending them a Direct Message (DM), sharing the link in a Tweet, and by copying the link and sharing it somewhere else like in an email.\n\n\n\n\n6.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Up to 10 other people can have speaking privileges in my Space at the same time, and I can choose who speaks and who doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t. People can also request to speak, and I can choose to approve their request or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. When people join my Space, I may hear one or multiple people speaking at the same time. If I think they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re too loud, I can turn down my volume or mute them.\n\n\n\n\n8. I can revoke speaking privileges, and block, remove or report someone if they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re being offensive or disruptive to me or others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0When someone says something I want to react to, I can choose an emoji to show everyone how I feel.

When I end my space it will end for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet'

b'My path into digital community building was carved out for me by my parents, in real life. My community,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#blkcreatives\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0(pronounced\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0hashtag Black creatives) reflects the values they modeled in their partnership: honesty, relatability, respect, and authenticity \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 and Twitter has been the tool we use to build out those values, influencing a generation to use their work for the betterment of everyone around them, online and off.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\nWhen my mother married my stepfather by law, but my Dad by love, they decided to both leave their current homes and find a middle ground. We were coming from Chicago, my first hometown; their compromise made Memphis my second. It was closer to our Mississippi roots and far enough away from the city for me to appreciate taking alternate routes.'

b'Our consistent traveling from one home to another during my childhood meant that I was always being introduced to a new cast of characters in the story of my life. But after graduating from college, I didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t see any stories that reflected the reality that I wanted to actually live. That\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s what inspired me to create\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#blkcreatives. The heart of this brand is a virtual community of Black creative professionals looking to create full, healthy, and sustainable lives \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 much like what my parents set out to do.'

b'Twitter has become a vital tool for how we not only build, but sustain the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#blkcreatives\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0community. My parents\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 strategy, experiences, and perspectives, was a strong example for me at 10-years-old. Who I am is a direct reflection of their decision to build a life in the South, and it created my desire to observe the details in all of my surroundings, and ultimately fueled my love for storytelling.\nI\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m someone who\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s always been a bit of an outlier in the digital industry, but Twitter has opened the door to opportunities for me, which in turn have allowed me to hold the door open for others. In the middle of the wildest summer ever \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 summer 2020 \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 something even wilder happened. Two of my\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Tweets were turned into billboards\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to support Black Lives Matter. This was already a big deal, but what I didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t expect is how much it raised the visibility of our mission. Now, I know that sounds like a clich\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9, but during a time of complete lockdown, seeing a physical, tangible statement meant everything to me.'

b'The response to it was enormous and really served as a proof of concept for me. And because our visibility was raised, it made it easier for people to support our mission of empowering and uplifting Black creatives from a financial, emotional, AND mental standpoint. From that moment we were able to not only donate funds to those in need but we also were able to connect creatives to viable opportunities by way of our\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0job board\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and direct referrals.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@blkcreatives\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0is so special to our industry because we take every opportunity and resource that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s given to us, and pour it back into our community in some way. We create with an intention to serve this demographic of Black creatives \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 a demo that is often commodified before they are genuinely supported. Our representation brings our humanity to the forefront. Beyond black squares and diversity and inclusion causes, there are real, actual people who need support and we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re committed to sharing and telling their stories. Context is just as important as content, especially in this digital age.\nTwitter has also allowed us to act as an amplifier for the missions that elevate what really matters. Through creating intentional digital Twitter-only experiences like our infamous\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter chats. They\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve literally been the reason why our community has gained so much visibility on Twitter. Once you find a way to nurture your community on Twitter, the possibilities will reveal themselves. Our Twitter chats have also been the key to staying constantly engaged with how our community is feeling and how we can support them.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen I think of the stories that reflect our mission, I think about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Michell Clark. Since 2015, Michell has been a guest at least 3 times for our Twitter chats and our friendship began through this platform. As a writer who writes affirmations for Black creatives, through\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0our chats and connection on Twitter, we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve been able to watch him continuously reach new heights while empowering us. Or I think about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Lisa Beasley. Another life-long friend that I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve met through our Twitter chats. Last November, after witnessing her hilarious Margaret Thatcher impression, I urged her to share it on Twitter and we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d amplify it. The video went viral with millions of views and that moment has led to incredible opportunities for her. I also think about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Ariana Walton Smith, a content creator who I referred to for a position at\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0We Are Rosie. Through Twitter, We Are Rosie\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Kiana Pirouz\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0connected with me and the referral not only resulted in a new career level for Ariana but also a valuable team experience for a company doing amazing, necessary work. I also think about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Nefertiti, a Memphis hair care expert, that I was referred to via Twitter.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n@blkcreatives\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0contribution to this industry is best told through the community we serve and their stories. What diversity fails to recognize, is that behind the statistics and data around race, Black creators are real people, with real stories, struggles, experiences, and insight. It doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t take into account the fullness of our humanity and our range. @blkcreatives is dedicated to translating that value via our stories and the other communities we inspire to do the same. When you inspire @blkcreatives, we pour that into other Black creatives and their ecosystems which strengthen our culture holistically as well as financially and mentally.'

b'The stories I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve shared here are just a handful of a much larger collection, and I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m grateful to be a part of a vision that widely impacts this generation of Black creatives. Twitter allows me to see and leverage that influence on the internet every single day.\nMy hope for Black creatives as they continue to navigate the creative space is that they continue to embrace and own their autonomy and creative freedom, stay connected to strategic resources, take care of themselves, and that they are compensated handsomely for their contributions to culture. I hope that they lead with authenticity vs attention. Attention is fleeting, it lasts a moment, and then it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s taken away by the next craze. Authenticity leads to connection, relationship, and community. It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s been our primary strategy for garnering support on Twitter and it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s never failed us yet.'

I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve been all over the gaming industry, and a passion for learning everything I can has seen my career hop from game development, to the software side, to streaming, and now to esports. I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve been gaming since I was a kid. In 1996, my dad bought me an N64 for Christmas and I was hooked. My Latinidad and gaming were always intermixed. When my cousins visited from Colombia, they would help me beat Zelda. I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d show my tios my Pokemon collection. And even during our rehearsal for my Quincea\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1era, my friends and I would try to finish early so we could all play Smash Bros together.'

b'Was there a specific experience that highlighted the need for more Latinx representation in the gaming industry?\n\n\r\nI love marketing and events, but at times, it was difficult to deal with the microaggressions I faced as Latinx and being homesick for a country I couldn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t visit often. My heart hurt and I felt unheard. But it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s never been in me to rest or sit still, so I decided to do something about it.\nEvery year, at every convention I went to, I would meet a Latinx person. The reactions would vary: hugging, dancing, or sharing stories of camaraderie, like \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cOnly Latinx person at your studio too, huh?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d These moments were fleeting and would lead to a Twitter connection or maybe a coffee at the next convention, but never something more. I would count on my fingers the number of Latinx folks I knew, and sometimes I counted them when I was frustrated with a work situation or feeling isolated in my Latinidad. I knew there were other Latinx, but I didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t know where I could find them. There weren\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t many resources for Latinx professionals back then, and I didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t see places for them to interconnect outside of work.'

b'How did Latinx in Gaming get started?\n\r\nI started\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Latinx in Gaming, as a panel. I invited folks through Twitter to join me at GDC (Game Developers Conference). The panel was an incredible success! All these feelings I had on being lonely, being unseen, and being unheard weren\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t just shared \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 they were a common experience in the Latinx community. We felt we had to keep that momentum going.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nLatinx in Gaming grew. We hosted panels at every convention, we met most of our contacts through conventions or Twitter and kept in touch there. We built out a Discord, a Facebook page, a LinkedIN. We kept speaking publicly, kept talking to our people, and kept asking other Latinx professionals to share their stories.\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWe\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re so glad you turned to Twitter to create\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@latinosingaming! Were there any particular strategies you used to build up the community?\n\r\nHonestly, our strategy was a couple different pieces. Firstly, we consistently asked our audience to share with us other Latinx folks of note. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGive us women in the space you admire, tell us people who uplift you.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d We would follow those folks or message them. Anytime we put on an event, we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d Tweet that we want volunteers, usually with a form. We\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve developed our network overtime this way. There\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s still a ton of folks we haven\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t reached, but Twitter helped us grow from 5 followers to 5,000. Finally, it was important to be unafraid to share voices. When we first started out, we tried to avoid \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cspamming\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the timeline. But we realized that by Retweeting Latinx folks, and Retweeting responses to us, we were building an audience and giving folks a platform to see and find each other. We were a mouthpiece and it was okay to be loud.\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nDo you have a go-to Twitter feature(s) you love to use?\n\nWe love\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0scheduling Tweets. We do a lot of things throughout the months that show off Latinx voices and having it all scheduled out in advance helps us be organized and makes our Tweets look super polished.'

b'Is there a story from the Latinx in Gaming community that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s close to your heart?\n\r\nLast year, we held\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Unidos Online, a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration with over 60 pieces of content going live. We Tweeted\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Lists\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0upon Lists of developers to follow, we uplifted folks who were looking to hire, we uplifted folks looking for a job. For us, Twitter was the mouthpiece, the platform that we yelled from the rooftops that we existed.

b"Twitter has played a major part in the growth of Black Girl Gamers \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 we wouldn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t be where we are without it. It's the platform that houses all the discussions, updates and news in the Gaming industry, but also allows you to express your personality.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nGaming is...interesting. Since a young age, I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve enjoyed escaping to various fantasy worlds but it was always a matter of time until I was brought back to reality. When I was young, it was in the form of absence of Black women characters \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 one or two would grace the screen but as stereotypes that were so predictable, bland, and offensive. Now don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t get me wrong, I didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t expect Black women to be in Crash Bandicoot (a game about a spinning marsupial), but our appearances were so far and few between that, at one point, I believed gaming to be a completely white male hobby.\xc3\x82"

b'When online gaming arrived, it brought along with it another forum for white male gamers to flex their colonial attitudes towards anything they deem of value; once again taking me out of the fantasy world and into reality. And when gaming conversations were born online, they brought that toxicity with them. I grew tired and stopped gaming online for years, but after seeing some male \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cfriends\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d from university create their own gaming channels with truly mediocre content and borderline offensive commentary \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 I started my own channel along with my personal Twitter page.'

b'Though I abandoned my gaming channel endeavours to focus on creating\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Black Girl Gamers, it was via my\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0personal Twitter page\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0that I met friends like\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@ljay90, most likely via hashtags like\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#blackgamers, who in turn introduced me to fellow Black women gamers such as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@junaebenne,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@chasinglux, and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@astylishjedi\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0(who still helps manage our Twitter page) who later became the first Community Management team for Black Girl Gamers. They, like myself, felt either annoyed, ostracised, invisible, undervalued or needed camaraderie.\nIf I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m being honest, I was bored of some of the conversations about race and gaming that I saw online. They were so frequently rooted in assimilation or fear of rocking developers\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 boats. I felt concessions were made on the behalf of Black gamers to comfort developer fragility that would hold us back in the long run. Ultimately, something was missing from these discussions, and in hindsight it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s only now that I realise it was the vim. To be vocal online meant braving a tidal wave of whitesplaining, mansplaining, or racist responses. I wanted\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Black Girl Gamers\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to contribute positively to the narrative so I created the Twitter handle. Having a Twitter page brought visibility to our experiences and opinions to many, including those who disagreed with our Tweets. But, it isn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t always serious stuff, I love to crack jokes and often make threads such as \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIf Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 were a Fantasy RPG character\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d because there was an unspoken feeling that Black pop culture was juxtaposed to gaming culture at times.'

b'Over time,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Black Girl Gamers\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0grew into a bastion for Black women in the industry, whether or not they were a part of our private community.

Interacting with our supporters comes naturally. We chat, ask them to teach us, we boost Tweets for good causes, and share jokes with our supporters \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re human and it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s important to come across as that.

It took thick skin but before I knew it, Retweets on our Tweets calling out publishers would spread our message and our Tweets would often, and still do, have a seat at the table in rooms full of professionals that were too scared to actually speak to or employ Black women directly. Black women from all over the world have come to feel seen by reading our Tweets and appreciate the authenticity in our purpose. We spark and join discussions up until the point of exhaustion or our point being made. And because of this, we still receive messages of thanks for bringing issues to the forefront and using representation in games as the entry point to incite change.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTwitter is a key part of our strategies for Black Girl Gamers. We receive our best analytics from Twitter, which is due to the massive gamer audience on the platform and the speed at which conversation can spark.

Mi actividad, en ese entonces, se centraba sobre todo en estos temas que me interesan y preocupan. Lamentablemente, en mayo y junio del a\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1o 2017, algo muy lamentable sucedi\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3 en mi comunidad, un grupo violento nos atac\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3 y nos despoj\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3 del manantial del que mi comunidad hab\xc3\x83\xc2\xada tomado agua potable hist\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3ricamente. Nuestra infraestructura hidr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1ulica, construida con trabajo comunitario, fue completamente destruida; aunado a eso, muchas personas fueron heridas y varias mujeres fueron secuestradas.\nToda la comunidad qued\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3 afectada aunque particularmente la poblaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n infantil y de la tercera edad. La b\xc3\x83\xc2\xbasqueda de justicia por estos hechos y la necesidad de volver a ser conectados a nuestro manantial fue larga y a trav\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s de distintos medios. La denuncia en Twitter a trav\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s de los perfiles de las personas que pertenecemos a la comunidad fue uno de esos medios, desde mi cuenta fui narrando las injusticias que est\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1bamos sufriendo y denunciando las amenazas que recibimos cotidianamente. Muchas personas a las que conoc\xc3\x83\xc2\xad virtualmente a trav\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s de Twitter comenzaron a preguntarme sobre lo que estaba sucediendo en mi comunidad, para conjuntar este tema, comenc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 a utilizar el\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#AguaParaAyutlaYa\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0pues la situaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n se tornaba cada vez m\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1s dif\xc3\x83\xc2\xadcil.\nA principios de mayo de 2019,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 a punto de que mi comunidad cumpliera dos a\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1os sin acceso al agua potable, la escritora mexicana Gabriela Ja\xc3\x83\xc2\xbaregui, impuls\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 junto a muchas mujeres, la denuncia de la situaci\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3n en la que se encontraba mi comunidad.

In our community and in our culture, oral tradition is extremely important. (Side note: I prefer to call it \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cmnemonic tradition,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d because its support is derived from memory.)\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAn important element of the daily work in my home is good conversation in my mother tongue, Mixe. These precious conversations are where anecdotes, stories, questions, and laughter abound. And now that I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve been back living in my community for the last few years, one of the activities I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve missed the most is speaking with people who are geographically far away.'

b'Ten years ago, I signed up for Twitter. At first, I only spent a little time on the platform and then I left for a while. However, I soon realized that my Twitter account was a space for me to continue exercising in the exchange of words and conversations. This is a vital activity for me. Twitter was and is where I can talk to friends who are elsewhere, with people I have never physically met, and with people I may have affinities with. And even others with whom I have open and confronting differences with. On Twitter, I can also raise ideas around the activism in which I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m involved, such as the fight for the preservation of linguistic diversity. For this in particular, I use Twitter to write in my native language and to share an account of the beautiful diversity in our world.'

I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m inspired by them. My activism used to focus on all the issues that interested and concerned me. But then in May and June 2017, something very horrific happened in my community. A violent group attacked us and deprived us of the spring from which my community had historically used for drinking water. Our hydraulic infrastructure \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 built through community work \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 was completely destroyed. In addition to that, many people were injured and several women were kidnapped.\nOur entire community was affected, but particularly children and the elderly.'

b'From my own account I was narrating the injustices that we were suffering and denouncing the threats we received on a daily basis. Many people I met virtually on Twitter asked me about what was happening in my community, and how they could help. So I began to use\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#AguaParaAyutlaYa\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0(Water For Ayutla Already) as the situation became increasingly difficult.\n\nIn May 2019, my community was going on two years without access to drinking water. Gabriela Ja\xc3\x83\xc2\xbaregui, a Mexican writer, along with countless women, helped to actively denounce the situation affecting my community. What happened immediately afterwards was impressive: many Twitter accounts from people with incredibly diverse profiles began using\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#AguaParaAyutlaYa\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to help put pressure on the authorities in charge of delivering justice to our community. Thousands of people, including writers, human rights activists, and journalists from different media outlets, joined our cause. And our voice. As a result, the local authorities accepted an interlocution with our community. Since then we have felt more seen in the process of seeking justice.'

b"#AguaParaAyutlaYa\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0has kept the conversation alive around the basic human right to accessing water in our community, and has accompanied our peaceful struggle to achieve justice. Additionally, as we all were confronted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we used Twitter to demand the need for water even louder as water is essential for proper hand washing.\nUnfortunately, we have not yet been able to reconnect to our source despite the fact that a federal judge has agreed with us in legal terms. Nonetheless, our fight continues. Through\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#AguaParaAyutlaYa\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I report daily on the news and our progress and through it, people help us to denounce and spread the word that Ayutla still needs water. Our Twitter solidarity is constant, however. We see accounts such as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@LeonardoIsaura,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@darkolina, and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0@el_nomad_cook\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0committed to and Tweeting about our struggle.\nA notable Twitter movement from them was on April 15, 2020 \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 where a call for artists and illustrators to create drawings and illustrations went out to demand\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0#AguaParaAyutlaYa. This call resulted in more than 100 illustrations demanding justice and water for our community and its impact was so tremendous that it caught the attention of various media outlets, such as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0El Universal\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0La Jornada. Through my Twitter account, I have expressed how grateful we are in our community. All of this amazing support from people we don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t personally know offline, yet they've helped us to publicly denounce this horrific situation we are going through."

b'When New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and issued a stay-at-home order, I, like many other Americans, went shopping to stockpile food and necessities. As I saw lines grow and shelves emptied, I decided to make purchases not only for myself, but for my mother and sister. But as I waited for the cashier to bag my items, I thought of the many individuals who did not have the cash on hand to buy items before they were sold out. Or those who did not have a family member to go shopping for them.\n\xc3\x82'

b'\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nGovernor Phil Murphy\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s stay-at-home order was an important executive order to stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus. But while it may have prevented many from suffering symptoms of COVID-19, it did not prevent communities already suffering from food insecurity. If the goal was for the most vulnerable population to survive the pandemic through self-quarantine, how could they survive if they could not leave their homes to retrieve the groceries, medicine, and necessities to sustain themselves?\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAround this time, I began seeing activists on my Twitter timeline share sign up sheets to join mutual aid neworks. These networks were quickly popping up all over the country. They were self-organized groups of people sharing resources and supporting neighbors who needed help to survive the pandemic. Recognizing the value in these forms, I did what all good organizers do: I copied it.'

b'As the threat of food insecurity grew, a local IHOP reached out to me, seeking to donate breakfasts. I contacted a local senior home to see if they were able and willing to accept the food donations. I delivered 25 breakfasts for a few days until a senior asked, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cAre you doing dinner, too?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d I said, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSure.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d And now, we are delivering 200 dinners, 3 days a week to seniors throughout the city of Paterson.\nAs the demand for the resource grew, so did the need for additional help and funds. By sharing pictures, videos, and our journey on\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter, we began to raise enough money to both expand and continue our operation. People enjoyed the behind the scenes footage of prepping the food and pictures of the seniors we delivered to. We relied heavily on others seeing and sharing our Tweets to raise money to sustain our mutual aid. Posting on Twitter allowed us to garner support from outside our local community, and it quickly became noticed by media outlets who went on to cover our work.'

b'But posting on Twitter wasn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t simply a way to gain exposure. Twitter has always been a platform to share your life and thoughts with others. There were hundreds of new infections in my city.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Dozens of new deaths. Myself and my team constantly feared we would be next. We shared the good. But we also shared the bad. We constantly discussed shutting down the operation. But each day, we found ourselves back at the restaurant preparing to deliver to seniors that we began to develop bonds with.\nLike the one senior who told me they needed supplies. I called to tell her I purchased them. While on the call she told me she hadn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t been able to get her medicine. I told her I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll pick it up. She said she wanted to hug me, but she can\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t.\nMoments like this meant something to me. But as I shared these moments on Twitter, I learned that it meant something to others as well. It was these moments that were connecting me to strangers online, not simply mutual followers. Twitter is a platform that allows us to share our stories, so my advice to others is, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cTell it.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\nOur efforts taught us that community isn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t simply about living in proximity to someone, but supporting a fellow human being in times of need.

Todos os dias eu aprendia uma coisa nova que me ajudava a resistir e todos os dias os livros me proporcionaram pequenas revolu\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7\xc3\x83\xc2\xb5es.\nLer tanto, me proporcionou escrever e nomear minhas pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3prias experi\xc3\x83\xc2\xaancias. Nomear as minhas pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3prias experi\xc3\x83\xc2\xaancias proporcionou uma compreens\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o mais ampla sobre as formas de manifesta\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o do racismo, sobre os estere\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3tipos que s\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o articulados para manter pessoas negras em lugares de subordina\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o, sobre as ideologias racistas e sobre as hierarquias que o racismo articula. A leitura me possibilitou conhecimento aut\xc3\x83\xc2\xb4nomo, o conhecimento aut\xc3\x83\xc2\xb4nomo blindou meu intelecto de ser desconstitu\xc3\x83\xc2\xaddo pelas l\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3gicas da viol\xc3\x83\xc2\xaancia racista epist\xc3\x83\xc2\xaamica que atravessa os processos de educa\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o institucional. A leitura me possibilitou usar a escrita para refletir minha pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3pria vez, e o\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0foi a ferramenta onde consegui dizer o que penso e como penso para muitas pessoas ao mesmo tempo.\nEscrever no Twitter\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0sobre meu cotidiano, meus estudos, minhas impress\xc3\x83\xc2\xb5es sobre a sociedade fizeram com que eu constitu\xc3\x83\xc2\xadsse uma rede com milhares de pessoas. O exerc\xc3\x83\xc2\xadcio da influ\xc3\x83\xc2\xaancia no Twitter, entretanto, precisava servir para um prop\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3sito maior que a repercuss\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o da minha pr\xc3\x83\xc2\xb3pria voz. Eu precisava agir de forma a compartilhar as pequenas revolu\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7\xc3\x83\xc2\xb5es que os livros me proporcionavam.\nNo dia 20 de novembro de 2018, Dia da Consci\xc3\x83\xc2\xaancia Negra no Brasil, a partir de um simples Tweet, eu iniciei uma rede de compartilhamento de livros para pessoas negras. Tudo come\xc3\x83\xc2\xa7ou com uma simples sugest\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0ei, pessoas brancas! Que tal FAZER algo para contribuir na luta contra o racismo ao inv\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9s de apenas se auto congratular por se anunciar enquanto antirracista? Que tal doar um livro para uma pessoa negra que precisa de um livro e n\xc3\x83\xc2\xa3o pode comprar?'

My grandmother taught me how to read, my mother said all the time how smart and special I was. I played and laughed with my sister and my cousins \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x8b\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x8band I felt important. My life was important, what I thought was important, and learning more and thinking more was encouraged every day.\nBooks were a part of every aspect of my daily life. There was a book everywhere in my house. Adult books, children's books, books about how things work, and books with stories about the beauty of the world. I even learned my name from the cover of one of those many books: Winnie Mandela\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s autobiography,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Part of My Soul. It was on that cover that I recognized my name and myself."

b'And yet, the impacts of racism on the outside world did not allow my mother and grandmother to protect me from racial violence. I went to school and was almost always the only Black child in my classroom\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93sometimes the only Black child in the entire school. What used to be celebration, became violence. The racist jokes of colleagues became more frequent, and so I started to doubt that I was smart, special, beautiful, and important. This racial violence at school could have meant my silence, it could have meant the infeasibility of my intellectual potentials, it could have meant the end of the flourishing of a Black feminist political conscience, but thanks to the books that had surrounded me in my house, the experience of racial violence from an early age gave me the strength that I would need to resist.\n\xc3\x82'

b"\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhenever I was hurt at school, my grandmother reminded me that knowledge is one of the few things in life that no one can take away from us. And that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s why I had an urge to read. I read all the books my mother bought, all the books in the school library, all the books that I could get my hands on. I read and my grandmother read with me. Then we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d discuss the stories. My grandmother has taught me the importance of not letting anyone control our own narrative from conversations we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99d have about the stories we had read together. Every day I learned something new to help me resist and every day those books gave me small revolutions.\n\r\nReading so much, allowed me to write and name my own experiences. Naming my own experiences has provided a broader understanding of the ways in which racism manifests itself, the stereotypes that are articulated to keep Black people in places of subordination, racist ideologies, and the hierarchies that racism articulates. Reading enabled me to have autonomous knowledge. A knowledge that shielded my intellect from being deconstructed by the logic of epistemic racist violence deep-rooted in the processes of institutional education. Reading made it possible for me to use writing to reflect my own experiences.\nAnd\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0was the tool where I was able to say what I think and how I think to many people at the same time.\nTweeting\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0about my daily life, my studies, and my impressions of society made me form a network with thousands of people. The exercise of influence on Twitter, however, needed to serve a purpose greater than the repercussion of my own voice. I needed to act in order to share the small revolutions that books gave me.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nOn November 20, 2018, Black Awareness Day in Brazil, from a simple\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Tweet, I started a book sharing network for Black people. It all started with a simple suggestion:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0You know what would be cool to celebrate Black Conscious Day? You, a white privileged person who self congratulates yourself for advertising as an anti-racist, donating a book to a Black person who needs a book and can't buy it."

We\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve had support from people like Emicida, a really famous rapper in Brazil, and Gilberto Gil, one of the most important artists in Brazilian musical history. We share books from publishers that help us, we share books from people all around the world who understand the impact of racism in Brazil, and how racism influences educational institutions.

Often, they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll try to trick you with a link that goes to a fake login page. Whenever you are prompted to enter your Twitter password, take a quick look at the URL in the address bar of your browser to make sure you're on twitter.com. Additionally, if you receive a Direct Message (even from a friend) with a URL that looks odd, we recommend you do not open the link.\nPhishing websites will often look just like Twitter's login page, but will actually be a website that is not Twitter. Twitter domains will always have https://twitter.com/ as the base domain.

Login alerts are only sent following new logins through Twitter for iOS and Android, twitter.com, and mobile web.\nThrough these alerts, you can verify that it was you who logged in from the device. If you did not log in from the device, you should follow the steps in the notification to secure your account, starting by changing your Twitter password immediately. Please note that the location listed in the notification is an approximate location derived from the IP address you used to access Twitter, and it may be different from your physical location.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you log in to your Twitter account from incognito browsers or browsers with cookies disabled, you will receive an alert each time.\n\n\n\n\nEmail address update alerts\n\n\nAny time the email address associated with your Twitter account is changed, we will send an email notification to the previously-used email address on your account.

However, URL shorteners can obscure the end domain, making it difficult to tell where the link goes to.\nSome browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, have free plug-ins that will show you the extended URLs without you having to click on them:\n\nURL Expanders for Chrome\nURL Expanders for Firefox\nIn general, please use caution when clicking on links. If you click on a link and find yourself unexpectedly on a page that resembles the Twitter login page, do not enter your username and password. Instead, go to twitter.com and log in directly from the Twitter homepage.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nKeep your computer and browser up-to-date and virus-free\n\n\nKeep your browser and operating system updated with the most current versions and patches\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94patches are often released to address particular security threats. Be sure to also scan your computer regularly for viruses, spyware, and adware.\nIf you're using a public computer, make sure you sign out of Twitter when you're done.\n\n\nSelect third-party applications with care\n\n\nThere are many third-party applications built on the Twitter platform by external developers that you can use with your Twitter account(s). However, you should be cautious before giving third-party applications access to your account.\nIf you wish to grant a third-party application access to your account, we recommend that you only do so using Twitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s OAuth method. OAuth is a secure connection method and doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t require you to give your Twitter username and password to the third party. You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give your username and password to an application or website, as third-party applications don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t need your username and password to be granted access to your account via Oauth. When you give your username and password to someone else, they have complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended. Learn about connecting or revoking third-party applications.\n\nWe suggest you review third-party applications that have access to your account from time to time. You can revoke access for applications that you don't recognize or that are Tweeting on your behalf by visiting the Applications tab in your account settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet"

=== b'Tweet location FAQs' ===

b'What location information is attached to my Tweets?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nEnabling precise location allows you to selectively add location information to your Tweets. This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0This allows Twitter to collect, store, and use your precise location, such as GPS information.\nOnce you\'ve enabled precise location, you will be able to attach a location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your Tweet. Simply tap the location marker while composing your Tweet, and select the location you wish to tag.\nNote: Once you Tweet with a location, your next Tweet will automatically include a general location label. Learn how to turn location off at any time.Third-party applications or websites may let you Tweet with location, including your precise location. We ask these developers to clearly explain what information is being shared when you use their products to Tweet with location.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat controls do I have when I attach location information to my Tweets?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nEven after you enable Tweeting with your location, you have additional control over which Tweets (and what type of location information) is shared. With this in mind:\nTweet location is off by default, and you will need to opt in to the service.\nYou can turn Tweet location on or off at any time.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0You can delete your past location data from displaying in your Tweets in a single place (see this article for step-by-step instructions).Be cautious and careful about the amount of information you share online. There may be some updates where you want to share your location ("The parade is starting now" or "A truck just spilled delicious candy all over the roadway!"), and some updates where you want to keep your location private. Just like you might not want to Tweet your home address, please be cautious when Tweeting from locations that you don\'t want others to see.Remember that when you\'re opted into Tweet location, suggested locations may be offered to you, but you can still choose not to share your location for individual Tweets (see this article for instructions).Please familiarize yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications and devices you Tweet with so that you are always aware of the information you share.Remember, once you post something online, it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s out there for others to see.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat location information is displayed?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAll geolocation information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your browser or device. Twitter won\'t show any location information unless you\'ve opted in to the feature, and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your coordinates to us.If you have chosen to attach location information to your Tweets, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the Tweet.On twitter.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a neighborhood or city.When you use the in-app camera on Twitter for iOS and Android to attach a photo or video to your Tweet\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and toggle on the option to tag your precise location, that Tweet will include both the location label of your choice and your device\'s precise location (latitude and longitude), which can be found via API. Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you select.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0This is helpful when sharing on-the-ground moments.\nNote:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The option to share your precise location from the in-app camera is currently available only on newer versions of Twitter for iOS (6.26 or later) and on newer versions of Twitter for Android (version 5.55 or later).\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Application developers are required to be up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place, will be included in your Tweet. When you Tweet from a third-party application or mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be included in your Tweet.\n\n\n\n\nNote: In some areas, you have the option to label your Tweet with a specific business, landmark, or point of interest. These places are sourced from Foursquare. If you see an issue with a place, please report it via Foursquare\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Help Center. If you believe that a specific Tweet is abusive, please report it to Twitter.'

An email or website may be disguised to appear legitimate.\nIt can be difficult to recognize a spoofed email as they may look very convincing or appear to come from a Twitter email address. You can check the headers of an email to find out more about the source of the message, and you should be suspicious of new or unexpected emails. Twitter doesn't send emails with attachments, and will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat if I'm worried that someone has access to my Twitter username and password?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you suspect your account has been compromised, you can find out what to do on our compromised accounts help page.\nIf Twitter believes your account has been hacked, we may reset the account password to prevent the hacker from misusing your account.

=== b'About offensive content' ===

b'Twitter is a social broadcast network that enables people and organizations to publicly share brief messages instantly around the world. This brings a variety of people with different voices, ideas, and perspectives. People are allowed to post content, including potentially inflammatory content, as long as they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re not violating the Twitter Rules. It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s important to know that Twitter does not screen content or remove potentially offensive content.\nAs a policy, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users. However, targeted abuse or harassment may constitute a violation of the Twitter Rules and Terms of Service. If you are a victim of targeted abuse or harassment, read more about online abuse.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHave you seen something on Twitter you disagree with? Here are some tips that may help you deal with your situation:\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nConsider the context\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTwitter lets us participate in broad conversations and connect with people from many corners of the world. While hearing from more people can be enriching, it can also be a source of frustration and misunderstanding if the context of the conversation is not considered. Seeing your username mentioned in a Tweet can be confusing if you don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t understand why it was used.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen you see an upsetting Tweet, step back and consider the larger conversation it may be connected to. Since individual Tweets are short, the author\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s intended meaning may have been lost or distorted. Tweet back with a reply\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to join the conversation and surface the concern. Send a Direct Message if you would prefer to communicate privately. Having more information makes it easier to understand the context and can lead to healthy dialogue.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThink before you Tweet\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHealthy conversation is a shared responsibility.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0If your Tweet reply is identified as using potentially harmful or offensive language, we may ask you, via a prompt, if you want to review it before sending. There will be options to send, edit, or delete the Tweet reply. And if you think we make a mistake, you can let us know.\nNote: These prompts are only available to people using Twitter in English.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nBlock and ignore\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nUnderstanding the context often diffuses a negative or confusing interaction, but, there are times when further action, like unfollowing or blocking someone, may be more effective. When you block, you will not be notified when they mention you, Retweet you, like your content, add you to a list or follow one of your lists. You also won\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t see any of these interactions in your timeline.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nFor more information on how to manage a situation that you believe is abusive, read this article about online abuse.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThere are also many online safety resources\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0that can help.\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\x82'


=== b'About age screening on Twitter' ===

b'What is age screening?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAge screening is a way for brands and others to determine online whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, in a way that is consistent with relevant industry or legal guidelines. This makes it easier for advertisers and others with content not suitable for minors (e.g. alcohol advertisers) to advertise on Twitter.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHow does age screening work on Twitter?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTwitter has developed a solution for brands that requires new Twitter followers to enter their birth date before being permitted to follow their account. If you have already entered your date of birth on your profile page, it will be detected and you will be able to immediately follow the account. If you have not already entered your date of birth on your profile page, we will ask you to enter your date of birth on your profile page settings.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThe feature was designed to help brands determine whether a follower meets a minimum age requirement, while at the same time providing an easy and secure way for you to follow accounts that you would otherwise be blocked from following. Twitter advertisers who use the solution will not have access to your birthdate or age unless your birthday visibility settings permit them to view this information on your profile, but will know when you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve entered an age that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s above their indicated threshold. This feature is free, and available to a select number of our advertising partners.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nDoes age screening comply with applicable guidelines and best practices?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nCompliance with specific industry guidelines around age screening and age-based targeting is the responsibility of the brand.'


=== b'What to do about self-harm and suicide concerns on Twitter' ===

b'If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re not alone. Use the contact info below to get help.\nUnited States: Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Crisis workers are available 24 hours a day. Calls are free and confidential.Other countries & regions: To find a crisis center near you, visit International Association for Suicide Prevention.\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior, you should seek help as soon as possible by contacting services with expertise in crisis intervention and suicide prevention. You can also alert the Twitter team focused on handling reports associated with accounts that may be engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior if you encounter this type of content on Twitter.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTwitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s approach to content associated self-harm and suicide threats\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAfter receiving a report of someone who may be thinking about self-harm or suicide, Twitter will contact the affected individual to let them know that someone who cares about them identified that they might be at risk of harm. We will also encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources that can help.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nRecognize the signs\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nJudging behavior based on online posts alone is challenging, but there are potential warning signs or indicators that someone may be thinking about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 self-harm or suicide. Below are questions that you may ask yourself to help assess if an individual may be experiencing suicidal thoughts:\nDoes this person frequently post content about depression or feelings of hopelessness?\nIs this person posting comments about death or feelings that death is the only option?\nAre they posting comments about having attempted suicide in the past?\nAre they describing or posting photos of self-harm or identifying themselves as suicidal?\nHas their mood and the content of their posts changed recently?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\nIf you are concerned and know the person involved, it can be helpful to contact them personally\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 and encourage them to seek advice from dedicated services who may be able to help. If, on the other hand, you don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t know the person involved, you may still choose to contact them to express concern or refer them to dedicated organizations , a suicide hotline, or someone who might know them personally. If you don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t feel comfortable reaching out to the person on your own or aren\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t sure how to reach them, you can also alert Twitter via our dedicated reporting flow.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nManaging experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you are thinking about engaging in self-harm or suicidal behavior, or are experiencing feelings of depression or anxiety, it may help to talk to people that you trust or to connect with dedicated organizations who can provide support and assistance to help manage these experiences.\nDepression has a wide variety of symptoms and affects millions of people every year. Common symptoms include sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, loss of energy, difficulty thinking, and possibly thoughts of suicide. You might exhibit these types of behaviors, or they might be subtler. Either way, don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t ignore them.\n\xc3\x82'


=== b'About online abuse' ===

b'Being the target of online abuse and bullying is not easy to deal with. Knowing the appropriate steps to take to address your situation can help you through the process.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen to report it?\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWe\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve all seen something on the Internet we disagree with or have received unwanted communication. Such behavior does not necessarily constitute online abuse and cyberbullying. If you see or receive a reply you don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t like, unfollow and end any communication with that account.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf the behavior continues, it is recommended that you block the account. Blocking will prevent that person from following you, seeing your profile image on their profile page, or in their timeline; additionally, their replies or mentions will not show in your Notifications tab (although these Tweets may still appear in search).\nAbusive accounts often lose interest once they realize that you will not respond. If the account in question is a friend, try addressing the issue offline. If you have had a misunderstanding, it may be possible to clear the matter up face to face or with the help of a trusted individual.\nIf you continue receiving unwanted, targeted and continuous replies on Twitter, and feel it constitutes online abuse, consider reporting the behavior to Twitter.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTake threats seriously\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you believe you are in physical danger, contact the local law enforcement authorities who have the tools to address the issue.\nIf you decide to work with law enforcement, make sure to do the following:\nDocument the violent or abusive messages with print-outs or screenshots\nBe as specific as possible about why you are concernedProvide any context you have around who you believe might be involved, such as evidence of abusive behavior found on other websitesProvide any information regarding previous threats you may have received\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nYou can report the content to Twitter here.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nReach out to the people you trust\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhen dealing with negative or hurtful interactions, it can help to turn to family and friends for support and advice. Oftentimes, talking with your relatives or a close friend may help you figure out how you want to handle the situation or let you express your feelings so you can move on.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHelp others\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nTrying to figure out how to help someone in such a situation can be daunting. This Twitter Support article offers some suggestions for how to help a friend or family member with online abuse.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you see a violent or abusive message directed at someone else, communicate your concern to the recipient and encourage them to contact Twitter and their local authorities.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThere are also many online safety resources that can help.'

=== b'Glorification of violence policy' ===

b'Overview\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nMarch 2019\nYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.\nGlorifying violent acts could inspire others to take part in similar acts of violence. Additionally, glorifying violent events where people were targeted on the basis of their protected characteristics (including: race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease) could incite or lead to further violence motivated by hatred and intolerance. For these reasons, we have a policy against content that glorifies acts of violence in a way that may inspire others to replicate those violent acts and cause real offline harm, or events where members of a protected group were the primary targets or victims.\n\n\nWhat is in violation of this policy?\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nUnder this policy, you can\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t glorify, celebrate, praise or condone violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts. We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m glad this happened\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis person is my hero\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI wish more people did things like this\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d, or \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI hope this inspires others to act\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nViolations of this policy include, but are not limited to, glorifying, praising, condoning, or celebrating:\nviolent acts committed by civilians that resulted in death or serious physical injury, e.g., murders, mass shootings;attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent extremism policy); andviolent events that targeted protected groups, e.g., the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat is not a violation of this policy?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nOur focus is on preventing the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts, as well as violent events where protected groups were the primary targets or victims. Exceptions may be made for violent acts by state actors, where violence was not primarily targeting protected groups.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWho can report violations of this policy?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAnyone can report potential violations of this policy, whether they have a Twitter account or not.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHow can I report violations of this policy?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIn-app\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nYou can report this content for review in-app as follows:\nSelect Report Tweet from the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Select It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s abusive or harmful.Select Threatening violence or physical harm.Select the relevant option depending on who you are reporting on behalf of.Select up to 5 Tweets to report for review.Submit your report.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nDesktop\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nYou can report this content for review via desktop as follows:\nSelect Report Tweet from the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n icon.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Select It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s abusive or harmful.Select Threatening violence or physical harm.Select the relevant option depending on who you are reporting on behalf of.Select up to 5 Tweets to report for review.Submit your report.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nReport form\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nYou can also report this content for review via our abusive behavior reporting form, by selecting the Harassment option.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat happens if you violate this policy?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThe consequences for violating our glorification of violence policy depends on the severity of the violation and the account\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s previous history of violations.\nThe first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you continue to violate this policy after receiving a warning, your account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.\n\n\nAdditional resources\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nLearn more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement.\nTo learn about the link between glorifying violent acts and offline harm, you can refer to the research of Susan Benesch: Countering Dangerous Speech: New Ideas for Genocide Prevention and the Dangerous Speech Project.'

b'What types of copyright complaints does Twitter respond to?\n\nTwitter responds to copyright\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0complaints submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDMCA\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant counter-notice.\nTwitter will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement, such as allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded through our media hosting services, or Tweets containing links to allegedly infringing materials. Note that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are infringements (see our\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0fair use\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0article for more information).\nIf you are concerned about the use of your brand or entity\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s name, please review\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s trademark policy. If you are concerned about a parody, newsfeed, commentary, or fan account, please see the relevant policy\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0here. These are generally not copyright issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I a copyright holder? How do I know?\n\nIf you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work, please consult an attorney or another adviser as Twitter cannot provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more about copyright law including\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0http://copyright.gov,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0https://lumendatabase.org/, and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to consider before submitting a copyright complaint\n\nBefore submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider whether or not the use could be considered\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0fair use.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user. You can reply to the user\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Tweet or send the user a Direct Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without having to contact Twitter.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nPrior to submitting a formal complaint with Twitter, please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa7 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.\nNote: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph. If you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or if you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re infringing upon someone else\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s work, please consult an attorney or another advisor.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information do you need to process a copyright complaint?\n\nTo submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information:\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit Twitter to locate the material on our website or services;Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; andA statement that the information in the complaint is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you are reporting the content of a Tweet, please give us a direct link to that Tweet. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR TWITTER TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I file a copyright complaint?\n\nYou can report alleged copyright infringement by visiting Twitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Help Center and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0filing a copyright complaint.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0If you are logged in to twitter.com, you can visit the Twitter Help Center directly from your Twitter account by clicking the \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98Help\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 link located in the sidebar.\nFiling a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material in question.\nIf you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded, you may wish to use an agent to report for you.\nPlease be aware that under 17 U.S.C. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa7 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a copyright complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are claims processed?\n\nWe process copyright complaints in the order in which they are received. Once you\'ve submitted your ticket, we will email you a ticket confirmation. If you do not receive a ticket confirmation that means we did not receive your complaint and you should re-submit your complaint. However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright complaints will result in a delay in processing.\nIf we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the affected user(s) and provide them with a full copy of the reporter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s complaint (including the provided contact information) along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice. We will also forward a redacted copy of the complaint to\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Lumen, with your personal information removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)? \n\nIf we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive a copy of the complaint, including the reporter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s full name, email, street address, and any other information included in the complaint.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the reported user(s), you may wish to consider appointing an agent to submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required to submit the DMCA notice with valid contact information, and identify you as the content owner that they are representing.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTwitter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s response to copyright complaints may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright complaint, Twitter will make a good faith effort to contact the affected account holder with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a full copy of the complaint, along with instructions for filing a counter-notice.\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint regarding the content removed from your account, please respond to the support ticket we sent you.\nIn an effort to be as transparent as possible regarding the removal or restriction of access to user-posted content, we clearly mark withheld Tweets and media to indicate to viewers when content has been withheld (examples below). We also send a redacted copy of each copyright complaint and counter-notice that we process to Lumen, where they are posted to a public-facing website (with your personal information removed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          My content was removed from Twitter\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did I receive a copyright complaint?\n\nIf you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the content described in the complaint has been restricted. Please take the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes information on the complaint we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are monitoring the email address associated with your Twitter account.\nTip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will not resolve that complaint\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I want to contest the takedown?\n\nIf you believe that the materials reported in the copyright\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0complaints\r\nwere misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a counter-notification(s)\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0through our Help Center. A counter-notice is a request for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences. Alternatively, you may be able to seek a retraction of the copyright complaint from the reporter.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I seek a retraction?\n\nThe DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of the reporter. You may want to reach out and ask them to retract their notice using our\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0retraction form. This is the fastest and most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright complaint. Alternatively, the reporter can also send a retraction notice to\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0copyright@twitter.com.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Such notice should include: (1) identification of the material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter would like to retract their DMCA notice.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter, and only that reporter can issue a retraction.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 If a portion of your tweet has been withheld, the violation will not be resolved just by deleting the remaining portion.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I file a counter-notice?\n\nA counter-notice is a request for Twitter to reinstate the removed material, and is the start of a legal process that has legal consequences.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 For example, submitting a counter notice indicates that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal court and that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to the reporter and Lumen website.\nWith these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if you believe that this material was misidentified, or you have a good faith belief that the material should not have been removed.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 If you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re unsure whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you may want to consult with an attorney.\nTip:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright complaint may result in permanent account suspension. If you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice rather than re-posting the material.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information do you need to process a counter-notice?\n\nTo submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the following information:\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);Your full name, address (including country), telephone number, and for verification purposes, your Twitter username and associated email;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before that removal or disabling (the description from the copyright notice will suffice);A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; andOne of the following jurisdictional consent statements:\n(If your address is in the United States)\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located and I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\nOR\n(If your address is outside of the United States)\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n"I consent to any judicial district in which Twitter may be found, and I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll accept service of process from the person who provided notice under 17 U.S.C. 512 (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."\n\nTo submit a counter-notice, please provide all of the above information using our web form, located\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after I submit a counter-notice?\n\nUpon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice. This means that the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice will be shared to the person who filed the original notice.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against you.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.\nWe cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiling a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!\n\nPlease think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s behalf. There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if my account receives one or more copyright complaints?\n\nIf multiple copyright complaints are received about an account, or other evidence suggests a pattern of repeat infringement, Twitter may suspend that account in accordance with our Repeat Infringer Policy.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Our Repeat Infringer Policy takes valid retractions and counter-notices into account. Users suspended under that policy may file a suspension appeal using\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0this form.\nAdditionally, re-posting material that was already removed in response to a copyright complaint, indicating where to access copyrighted material on third party websites, or certain other actions that demonstrate your account is intended solely or primarily to infringe the copyrighted material of others may result in permanent account suspension. If you are suspended on this basis, you may file an appeal using\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0this form. Please be aware that appealing a suspension does not guarantee your account will be reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet'


=== b'About Twitter limits' ===

b"Why have limits?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nLimits alleviate some of the strain on the behind-the-scenes part of Twitter and reduce downtime and error pages. For the sake of reliability, we've placed some limits on the account actions below.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nCurrent Twitter limits\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThe current technical limits for accounts are:\nDirect Messages (daily): The limit is 500 messages sent per day.Tweets: 2,400 per day. The daily update limit is further broken down into smaller limits for semi-hourly intervals. Retweets are counted as Tweets.Changes to account email: 4 per hour.Following (daily): The technical follow limit is 400 per day. Please note that this is a technical account limit only, and there are additional rules prohibiting aggressive following behavior.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Following (account-based): Once an account is following 5,000 other accounts, additional follow attempts are limited by account-specific ratios.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThese limits include actions from all devices, including web, mobile, phone, API, etc. API requests from all third-party applications are tracked against the hourly API limit. People who use multiple third-party applications with their account will therefore reach the API limit more quickly.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nThese limits may be temporarily reduced during periods of heavy site usage. In such cases, we will post an update on the Twitter status site.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nWhat happens if I hit a limit?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you do reach a limit, we'll let you know with an error message telling you which limit you've hit. For limits that are time-based (like the Direct Messages, Tweets, changes to account email, and API request limits), you'll be able to try again after the time limit has elapsed.\nThe Tweet limit of 2,400 updates per day is further broken down into semi-hourly intervals. If you hit your account update/Tweet limit, please try again in a few hours after the limit period has elapsed.\r\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nHaving trouble?\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you've hit a follow limit, please see this follow limit troubleshooting article for more information."

We will tell you about this storage when you sign up for these features.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve turned this off, or are in the EU, \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland, we won't store or use these web page visits to improve your experience in the future. However, if we've previously stored your web browsing history, we may continue to personalize your experience based on information we've already learned from that history.\nYou will always see ads on Twitter based on your Twitter activity. There are a variety of ways you can adjust the way Twitter uses your data for ads.

Note that if you turn off cookies entirely, Twitter services may not work correctly\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0or you might have trouble logging into twitter.com.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nMore privacy options\r\n \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\nAlong with optout.aboutads.info, you can read more about opting out of interest-based ads at networkadvertising.org/choices.
